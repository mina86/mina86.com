<p>I’ve written about <a href="/2021/srgb-lab-lchab-conversions/">L*a*b*</a> so
  it’s only fair that I’ll also describe its twin sister: the L*u*v* colour
  space (a.k.a. CIELUV).  The two share a lot in common.  For example, they use
  the same luminance value, base their chromaticity
  on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opponent_process">opponent
  process</a> theory and each of them has a corresponding cylindrical LCh
  coordinate system.  Yet, despite those similarities — or perhaps because of
  them — the CIELUV colour space is often overlooked.

<p>Even though L*a*b* seems to be getting all the limelight, L*u*v* model has
  its advantages.  Before we start comparing the two colour spaces, let’s first
  go through the conversion formulæ.

<!-- FULL -->

<h2>sRGB and D<sub>65</sub></h2>

<p>Since I’ve already described <a href="/2019/srgb-xyz-conversion/">translation
  between sRGB and XYZ</a>
  (<a href="/2021/srgb-lab-lchab-conversions/">twice</a> in fact), this article
  will focus on relations between XYZ, xyY, L*u*v* and LCh<sub>uv</sub> colour
  spaces.

<p>This article is still going to have some sRGB bias and assume everything is
  computed in reference to the D<sub>65</sub> white point.  CIELUV can be
  calculated compared to arbitrary illuminant but if one starts with an sRGB
  colour it’s easiest to stick to the same white point.

<p>It’s important to keep in mind that others may use different
  illuminant — D<sub>50</sub> is another common choice — and that to properly
  convert an sRGB colour (which uses D<sub>65</sub>) to L*u*v* with a different
  white point, the XYZ coordinates need to be treated with a Bradford transform
  first.

<p>With those disclosures out of the way, let’s get to the conversion.  In
  addition to presenting Maths equations, I’ll present Rust implementation of
  the operations.  The code is also provided
  in <a href="https://crates.io/crates/luv">luv crate</a>.


<h2 na>XYZ or xyY to L*u*v*</h2>

<p>L*a*b* and L*u*v* colour models use the same luminance component.  Formula
  for calculating it will therefore be identical.  Equations for the other two
  coordinates depends on whether conversion is done from XYZ or xyY colour
  space.

  $$ \begin{align}
    L^*  &= \begin{cases}
      24389 Y / 27         & \text{if }24389 Y ≤ 216 \\
      116 \sqrt[3]{Y} - 16 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases} \\
    u^*  &= 13 L^* (u' - u_r') \\
    v^*  &= 13 L^* (v' - v_r') \\[.5em]

    u_r' &= 0.1978330369967827 \\
    v_r' &= 0.4683304743525223
  \end{align} $$

<p>The \(u_r'\) and \(v_r'\) variables specify chromaticity of the reference
  white point.  As discussed earlier, provided values are for D<sub>65</sub>
  illuminant.  The \(u'\) and \(v'\) values for any colour can be calculated
  from XYZ coordinates or xy chromaticity as follows:

  $$ \begin{align}
    u' &= 4X / D & u' &= 4x / d \\
    v' &= 9Y / D & v' &= 9y / d \\
    D &= X + 15Y + 3Z  & d  &= -2x + 12y + 3
  \end{align} $$

<p>Expressed in code, the formulæ look as follows (for brevity only the XYZ
  version is shown):

<pre>
/// Converts colour from XYZ space to CIELUV (a.k.a. L*u*v*) using
/// D65 reference white point.
fn luv_from_xyz(xyz: [f32; 3]) -&gt; [f32; 3] {
    const EPSILON: f32 = 216.0 / 24389.0;
    const KAPPA: f32 = 24389.0 / 27.0;
    const WHITE_U_PRIME: f32 = 0.1978330369967827;
    const WHITE_V_PRIME: f32 = 0.4683304743525223;

    let [x, y, z] = xyz;

    let l = if y &lt;= 0.0 {
        /* This case is needed to handle XYZ = (0, 0, 0)
           which would otherwise lead to division by zero. */
        return [0.0, 0.0, 0.0];
    } else if y &lt;= EPSILON {
        KAPPA * y
    } else {
        116.0 * y.powf(1.0 / 3.0) - 16.0
    };

    let d = x + 15.0 * y + 3.0 * z;
    let u = 13.0 * l * (4.0 * x / d - WHITE_U_PRIME);
    let v = 13.0 * l * (9.0 * y / d - WHITE_V_PRIME);

    [ l, u, v ]
}
</pre>


<h2 na>L*u*v* to XYZ or xyY</h2>

<p>Conversion in the opposite direction can be easily derived with all the
  operations simply performed in reverse:

  $$ \begin{align}
    Y &= \begin{cases}
      \left({L^* + 16 \over 116}\right)^3  & \text{if }L^* > 8 \\
      {27 L^* \over 24389}                 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases} \\
    u' &= {u^* \over 13 L^*} + u_r' \\
    v' &= {v^* \over 13 L^*} + v_r'
  \end{align} $$

<p>Like before, depending on whether conversion to XYZ or xyY colour space is
  desired, either of the two sets of equations should be used:

  $$ \begin{align}
    X &= Y {9u' \over 4v'}             & x &= {9 u' \over d} \\
    Z &= Y {12 - 3u' - 20v' \over 4v'} & y &= {4 v' \over d} \\
      &                                & d &= 6 u' - 16 v' + 12
  \end{align} $$

<p>Again limiting the code to XYZ colour space, the above written in Rust
  becomes:

<pre>
/// Converts colour from CIELUV (a.k.a. L*u*v*) space
/// using D65 reference white point to XYZ.
fn xyz_from_luv(luv: [f32; 3]) -&gt; [f32; 3] {
    const ONE_OVER_KAPPA: f32 = 27.0 / 24389.0;
    const WHITE_U_PRIME: f32 = 0.1978330369967827;
    const WHITE_V_PRIME: f32 = 0.4683304743525223;

    if luv.l &lt;= 0.0 {
        /* This case is needed to avoid division by zero */
        return [0.0, 0.0, 0.0];
    }
    let ll = 13.0 * luv.l;
    let u_prime = luv.u / ll + WHITE_U_PRIME;
    let v_prime = luv.v / ll + WHITE_V_PRIME;

    let y = if luv.l &gt; 8.0 {
        ((luv.l + 16.0) / 116.0).powi(3)
    } else {
        luv.l * ONE_OVER_KAPPA
    };

    let a = 0.75 * y * u_prime / v_prime;
    let x = 3.0 * a;
    let z = y * (3.0 - 5.0 * v_prime) / v_prime - a;

    [x, y, z]
}
</pre>


<h2>L*u*v* and LCh<sub>uv</sub></h2>

<p>The L*u*v* model represents chromaticity using a green-red (\(u'\)) and
  blue-yellow (\(v'\)) axes.  Those are hard to interpret (as per figure 1 at
  the beginning of the article) so for convince CIE defined a cylindrical
  LCH<sub>uv</sub> colour space (sometimes also called HCL).  It is based on
  CIELUV and uses the same L* value but encodes chromaticity using chroma
  (\(C^*\)) and hue (\(h\)).  If this all sounds familiar, it’s because this is
  the same motivation behind
  the <a href="/2021/srgb-lab-lchab-conversions/#lch">LCh<sub>ab</sub></a> and
  the formulæ used to convert between models are equivalent as well:

  $$ \begin{align}
    C^* &= \sqrt{u^{*2} + v^{*2}}  \\
    h   &= \text{atan}_2(v^*, u^*) \\[.5em]
    u^* &= C^* \cos(h)             \\
    v^* &= C^* \sin(h)
  \end{align} $$


<h2>Comparing L*a*b* and L*u*v*</h2>

<p>The CIELAB and CIELUV colour spaces both attempt to be perceptually uniform.
  Neither managed to achieve that goal and no clearly better model could be
  selected so in 1976 the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) adopted
  both.  If a commission full of experts couldn’t figure the best on out,
  I won’t convince anyone one way or another either.  It’s still worth keeping
  in mind that there are more than one almost perceptually uniform colour model
  and it may not always be the best option to default to L*a*b*.

  <figcaption>Fig. 2. The hue wheel stretched into a single band for HSL (top
      bar), LCh<sub>ab</sub> (middle) and LCh<sub>uv</sub> (bottom) colour
      spaces.  In the top band, S = 0.5 and L varies from 0.2 to 0.8.  In the
      middle and bottom bands, L* varies from 32.3 to 80.0.  In the middle
      (bottom) band, C* varies from 38.93 (44.13) at the edges to 77.85 (88.26)
      in the middle.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Figure 2 above depicts the full range of hues for HSL, LCh<sub>ab</sub> and
  LCh<sub>uv</sub> colour spaces.  The red, green and blue lines on the figure
  indicate sRGB colours whose other two values are equal.  In other words, the
  lines is where colour converted to sRGB has the coordinates (r, x, x), (x, g,
  x) or (x, x, b) respectively.  Those lines demonstrate the three primary hues
  are spaced more evenly in CIELUV model than in CIELAB.  This is, by the way,
  why the theme customisation on this blog uses the former colour space.

<p>There are of course other aspects to consider.  For example, with embedding
  of RGB gamuts in L*a*b* and L*u*v* having irregular shape, clipping may become
  an issue which affects the two models differently.

<p>As an aside, the figure also clearly demonstrates that HSL’s lightness is
  a misnomer.  HSL may be somewhat useful for picking colours as an alternative
  to RGB, but it shouldn’t but using it to compare or manipulate colours in
  a meaningfully way is not a good idea.


<h2>sRGB conversion optimisation</h2>

<p>To finish up, it might be worth nothing that if conversion is performed from
  an RGB colour system the implementation can be optimised a bit.  Normally, the
  chain of operations is RGB→linear RGB→XYZ→L*u*v* (and the same thing backwards
  when switching colour spaces in the opposite direction).  Moving between
  linear RGB and XYZ coordinates involves a handful of linear transformations
  which can be combined with some operations performed when converting between
  XYZ and L*u*v*..

<p>Firstly, observe that to calculate colour’s CIELUV coordinates we need
  \(4X\), \(Y\) and \(D = X + 15Y + 3Z\) values only.  This is because L* is
  a function of \(Y\), \(u' = 4X / D\) and \(v' = 9Y / D\).  Secondly, observe
  that colour’s XYZ coordinates are linear combination of \(Y\), \(Y / v'\) and
  \(Yu' / v'\) values.  In particular, \(X = 2.25Yu'/v'\) and \(Z = -5Y + 3Y/v'
  - 0.75Yu'/v'\).  With that we can derive the following:

  $$ \begin{align}
    \begin{bmatrix}
      4X \\ Y \\ D
    \end{bmatrix} &= \begin{bmatrix}
      4 & 0 & 0 \\
      0 & 1 & 0 \\
      1 & 15 & 3 \\
    \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
      X \\ Y \\ Z
    \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
      4 & 0 & 0 \\
      0 & 1 & 0 \\
      1 & 15 & 3 \\
    \end{bmatrix} M \begin{bmatrix}
      R \\ G \\ B
    \end{bmatrix} \\[.5em]

    \begin{bmatrix}
      R \\ G \\ B
    \end{bmatrix} &= M^{-1} \begin{bmatrix}
      X \\ Y \\ Z
    \end{bmatrix} = M^{-1} \begin{bmatrix}
      0 & 0 & 2.25\\
      1 & 0 & 0 \\
      -5 & 3 & -0.75
    \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
      Y \\ {Y \over v'} \\ {Y u' \over v'}
    \end{bmatrix}
  \end{align} $$

<p>In other words:

  $$ \begin{align}
    \begin{bmatrix}
      4X \\ Y \\ D
    \end{bmatrix} &= M^* \begin{bmatrix}
      R \\ G \\ B
    \end{bmatrix} & \text{where}\quad & M^* = \begin{bmatrix}
      4 & 0 & 0 \\
      0 & 1 & 0 \\
      1 & 15 & 3 \\
    \end{bmatrix} M \\[.5em]

    \begin{bmatrix}
      R \\ G \\ B
    \end{bmatrix} &= M^{-*} \begin{bmatrix}
      Y \\ {Y \over v'} \\ {Y u' \over v'}
    \end{bmatrix} & \text{where}\quad & M^{-*} = M^{-1} \begin{bmatrix}
      0 & 0 & 2.25\\
      1 & 0 & 0 \\
      -5 & 3 & -0.75
    \end{bmatrix}
  \end{align} $$

<p>The \(M\) and \(M^{-1}\) are of course <a href="/2019/srgb-xyz-matrix/">the
  RGB↔XYZ change of basis matrices</a>.  The insight here is that \(M^*\) and
  \(M^{-*}\) matrices can be calculated beforehand thus reducing number of
  operations when performing conversion between RGB and L*u*v* colour.

<p>It does lead to faster execution but due to the nature of floating point
  numbers it leads to less precise results.  This is pretty much the reason
  why <a href="https://crates.io/crates/luv">the luv crate</a> doesn’t currently
  use this optimisation.  Other implementations which favour speed may choose to
  do so.
