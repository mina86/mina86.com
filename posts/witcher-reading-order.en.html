<p>Without beating around the bush, the reading order for the Witcher books is
as follows:

<style>
.read-order tbody th {
    vertical-align: center;
    text-align: center;
    min-width: 3em;
}
.read-order tbody th span {
    font-style: italic;
    writing-mode: vertical-rl;
}
</style>

<table class=read-order>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>1.<td>The Last Wish
        <th rowspan=2><span>Short<br>stories</span>
    <tr><td>2.<td>Sword of Destiny
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>3.<td>Blood of Elves
        <th rowspan=5><span>The Witcher Saga</span>
    <tr><td>4.<td>Time of Contempt
    <tr><td>5.<td>Baptism of Fire
    <tr><td>6.<td>The Tower of the Swallow
    <tr><td>7.<td>The Lady of the Lake
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>8.<td colspan=2>Season of Storms
</table>

<!-- FULL -->

<p>Confusion regarding the order is quite understandable.  There is a handful of
  discrepancies which may make a new reader wonder.  Let’s address them one by
  one to dispel any lingering doubts:

<ul>
  <li><i>Blood of Elves</i> comes third even though in some editions it might
    say ‘Book 1’ on the cover.  That numbering, if present, refers to the books
    in The Witcher Saga which consists of five novels.  The saga starts soon
    after the events described in <i>Sword of Destiny</i>.
  <li><i>Season of Storms</i> comes last even though chronologically it takes
    place before the saga.  It references events from the other books and was
    written with the assumption that reader is familiar with the rest of the
    series.  Furthermore, the store of <i>Blood</i> continues straight after
    the <i>Sword</i> so it makes no sense to include a book in between.
  <li><i>The Last Wish</i> comes first even though it was published in Poland
    after <i>Sword of Destiny</i>.  It’s a collection of stories which had been
    already printed in <i>Fantastyka</i> magazine.  At that time, reader
    of <i>Sword</i> was aware of those preceding stories.
  <li><i>Sword of Destiny</i> comes second even though it was released in
    English fifth.  This one is on the publisher who, I’m speculating, concluded
    that it was easier to market the saga.
</ul>

<h2>Something Ends</h2>

<p>Another noteworthy book is <i>Something Ends, Something Begins</i>
  (pl. <i>Coś się kończy, coś się zaczyna</i>).  It’s an anthology including,
  among others, two stories related to the Witcher series: ‘A Road with No
  Return’ (pl. ‘Droga, z której się nie wraca’) and ‘Something Ends, Something
  Begins’.

<p>‘A Road’ wasn’t planned as a part of the series but eventual later stories
  implied that Visenna described there is the same one Geralt meets in
  ‘Something More’.  As a result, some consider the tale part of the canon.  As
  far as I know, Sapkowski never categorically stated things one way or another.

<p>‘Something Ends’ is a lighthearted non-canon story describing Geralt’s and
  Yennefer’s wedding.  It was first published before the saga, yet it references
  characters and events from novels.  Some call it an alternative ending though
  the author rejects such label.

<p>As far as I’m aware, the two stories have not been officially translated into
  English.
