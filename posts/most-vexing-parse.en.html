<p>Here’s a puzzle: What does the following C++ code output:

<pre>
#include &lt;cstdio>
#include &lt;string>

struct Foo {
	Foo(unsigned n = 1) {
		std::printf("Hell%s,", std::string(n, 'o').c_str());
	}
	~Foo() {
		std::printf("%s", " world");
	}
};

static constexpr double pi = 3.141592653589793238;

int main(void) {
	Foo foo();
	Foo bar(unsigned(pi));
}
</pre>

<!-- EXCERPT -->

<p>If your reaction is ‘What do you mean? It’s obvious!’ than you’ve answered
  incorrectly.  But if you’ve exclaimed ‘This is implementation-defined because
  there’s no terminating new-line character in text stream!’ than
  congratulations on knowing this fact; that’s still the wrong answer though.
  The correct reaction is a sigh followed by a lament at C++ syntax.

<p>The <code>Foo foo();</code> line is a <em>function declaration</em> and has
  no effect on the behaviour of the code.  Perhaps more confusingly, <code>Foo
  bar(unsigned(pi);</code> is <em>also</em> just a function declaration — this
  time of a function with a single unsigned argument — and doesn’t affect output
  of the program.  In the end, the program outputs nothing and returns with
  a zero exit status.

<p>This is an instance of the infamous <dfn>most vexing parse</dfn> which is
  a syntax ambiguity where a piece of code could be interpreted as a function
  declaration or creation of an object.  In those situations C++ mandates the
  syntax to be parsed as a function declaration.


<h2>Removing the ambiguity</h2>

<p>There are a few possible ways to force the compiler to treat the lines as an
  object definitions.  In case of <code>foo</code>, the simplest (and arguably
  best) is to remove the parenthesis all together.  In case
  of <code>bar</code>, an explicit cast, that is
  using <code>static_cast&lt;unsigned>(pi)</code>, would resolve the issue.

<p>C++11 offers another option in the form of aggregate initialisation (also
  known as brace initialisation).  Simply replace parenthesis around the
  supposed constructor arguments with braces and the code will behave as
  expected:

<pre>
static constexpr double pi = 3.141592653589793238;

int main(void) {
	Foo foo{};
	Foo bar{unsigned(pi)};
}
</pre>

<p>But before you go on a rampage and start replacing all parenthesis with
  braces…


<h2>Here’s another puzzle</h2>

<p>What does the following C++ code output:

<pre>
#include &lt;iostream>
#include &lt;vector>

int main(void) {
	typedef std::vector&lt;int> Vector;
	Vector a(6);
	Vector b{6};
	Vector c({6});
	Vector d(6, 9);
	Vector e{6, 9};
	Vector f({6, 9});
	std::cout << a.size() << ' ' << a[0] << ", "
	          << b.size() << ' ' << b[0] << ", "
	          << c.size() << ' ' << c[0] << ", "
	          << d.size() << ' ' << d[0] << ", "
	          << e.size() << ' ' << e[0] << ", "
	          << f.size() << ' ' << f[0] << '\n';
}
</pre>

<p>In constructor call the parenthesis can be replaced by braces so in the code
  above <code>a</code> is the same as <code>b</code> and <code>d</code> is the
  same as <code>e</code>, right?  Not so fast.

<ul>
  <li>The definition of variable <code>a</code> is equivalent to <code>Vector
    a(6, 0);</code>.  Nothing surprising here.  This constructs a six-element
    vector with all elements initialised to zero.
  <li>However, the definition of variable <code>b</code> is different.
    Because <code>std::vector</code> has a constructor which
    takes <code>std::initializer_list</code> as an argument, when braces are
    used that constructor is used.  As such, the <code>b</code> variable is in
    fact equivalent to <code>c</code>.  They are both one-element vectors
    holding the value six.
  <li>The definition of variable <code>d</code> is analogous to <code>a</code>
    and results in a six-element vector with all elements set to nine.  Again,
    no surprises there.
  <li>Finally, the definitions of variables <code>e</code> and <code>f</code>
    are equivalent and — just like with <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> — call
    constructor with an initialiser list resulting in a two-argument vector
    holding values six and nine.
</ul>

<p>The output of the program is therefore <code>6 0, 1 6, 1 6, 6 9, 2 6, 2
    6</code>.


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The most vexing parse is not a new issue — it fact it’s now two decades since
  Scott Meyers coined the term in his Effective STL book — and I certainly won’t
  make any new revelations about it.  It is unfortunate that in attempt to solve
  it the committee decided it was a good idea to allow braces themselves to be
  a shorthand for calling constructor with initialiser list.  This decision
  means that adding a constructor which takes <code>std::initializer_list</code>
  is now an API-breaking change.  How?  Let’s consider the following code:

<pre>
#include &lt;iostream>
#include &lt;memory>

struct DynArr {
	DynArr(size_t size) : ptr(std::make_unique&lt;int[]>(size)), sz(size) {}

	/*
	DynArr(std::initializer_list&lt;int> lst) : DynArr(lst.size()) {
		std::copy(lst.begin(), lst.end(), ptr.get());
	}
	*/

	size_t size() const { return sz; }
	int *data() { return ptr.get(); }
	int &amp;operator[](size_t offset) { return ptr[offset]; }
	int &amp;last() { return ptr[sz - 1]; }

private:
	const std::unique_ptr&lt;int[]> ptr;
	const size_t sz;
};

int main(void) {
	DynArr arr{5};
	arr[0] = arr[1] = 1;
	for (size_t i = 2; i &lt; arr.size(); ++i) {
		arr[i] = arr[i - 2] + arr[i - 1];
	}
	std::cout &lt;&lt; arr.last() &lt;&lt; '\n';
}
</pre>

<p>With only the <code>DynArr(size_t)</code> constructor present,
  the <code>DynArr arr{5}</code> definition allocates a five-element array and
  the code calculates fifth number in the Fibonacci sequence.  But if a later
  revisions of the class introduce
  the <code>DynArr(std::initializer_list&lt;int&gt;)</code> constructor, the
  same line will invoke this new constructor and later cause a buffer overflow.

<p>Unfortunately (as often is the case when talking about C++) there are no
  definite answers to the most vexing parse or the potential confusion with
  aggregate initialisation.  It’s remains one of those things a C++ programmer
  has to be aware of.


<h2>Epilogue: A bonus puzzle</h2>

<p>I’ll leave you, Dear Reader, with this puzzle.  What does the following C++
  code output:

<pre>
#include &lt;cstdio>
#include &lt;math.h>
#include &lt;string>

struct Foo {
	Foo(unsigned n = 1) {
		std::printf("Hell%s, world\n", std::string(n, 'o').c_str());
	}
};

int main(void) {
	Foo bar(unsigned(M_PI));
}
</pre>

<p>C and C++ are so much fun!
