<p>In September 2022, ‘Théâtre D’opéra Spatial’, a work submitted by Jason
  Allen, won Colorado State Fair’s annual fine art competition in the digital
  art category.  What made the success noteworthy was
  that <a href="https://nytimes.com/2022/09/02/technology/ai-artificial-intelligence-artists.html">the
  image had been AI-generated</a>.  Mr Allen eventually tried to register the
  work with the US Copyright Office but his attempts turned out fruitless.  In
  September
  2023 <a href="https://copyright.gov/rulings-filings/review-board/docs/Theatre-Dopera-Spatial.pdf">the
  Office refused his registration</a>.

<p>I didn’t think much of it at the time.  I wasn’t that invested in the
  consideration of what kind of ‘two-dimensional artworks’ are protected by
  copyright and, more notably, I somewhat agreed with the decision.  Perhaps the
  prompt was protected, but if only minor manual edits were made to the image,
  it felt like a stretch to say the image as a whole could be covered by
  copyright law.

<h2>An entrance to paradise</h2>

<p id=b1>‘Théâtre D’opéra Spatial’ wasn’t the first time US Copyright Office
  dealt with computer-generated images.  Back in 2016, Steven Thaler’s
  Creativity Machine
  created <a href="https://www.urbasm.com/2016/05/artificial-intelligence-visions-art-of-a-dying-brain/">a
  series of images</a> with one of them — ‘A Recent Entrance to
  Paradise’ — ending up under the Office’s deliberation.  The result was the
  same: in February
  2022, <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/rulings-filings/review-board/docs/a-recent-entrance-to-paradise.pdf">the
  Office refused the registration</a>.<sup><a href=#f1>1</a></sup> I was made
  aware of the image only after Leonard French, a US copyright attorney,
  made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtKCok9tILk">a video about the
  case</a>.  In it, he made the following comparison to photography:

<blockquote><p>Maybe [Thaler] could have argued that he had to select what
  images got put into the AI to create the output.  Maybe he can argue that
  there was some creativity in selecting the images and choosing the setting for
  the AI very much like we have protections for photographs because there is at
  least minimal human creativity in choosing what to photograph, with what lens,
  what focal length, what focus, what iris or aperture, what shutter speed, and
  then what post-processing settings to use.  That’s enough.  It’s maybe not
  that much, but it’s enough to reach copyright protection.</blockquote>

<p>This made me wonder what actually is the minimal human creativity that’s
  required for a work to be subject to copyright.


<h2>The lazy tourist</h2>

    nevertheless meats criteria for copyright protection.

<p>Specifically, consider a lazy tourist.  In his travels, he ends up on a beach
  and notices a flock of birds in the water.  He decides to take a photo of them
  with his mobile phone.  A marvellous device makes taking photos a seamless
  experience — no need to pick any settings, the phone automatically chooses all
  of them.  The tourist is a lazy one so he’s not going to walk too far to find
  a perfect framing.  He wonders a few steps, points his phone and makes a new
  work covered by the copyright.

<p>How much human creativity was there in this process?  The subject of the photo
  wasn’t carefully planned.  The tourist didn’t wake up one day deciding to make
  a photo of a flock of birds in the water.  He just stumbled upon them.  The
  choice of the subject was highly constraint without room for much creativity.

<p>Similarly, the tourist chose the framing but here again the options were
  limited.  He didn’t use a drone to make an aerial shot, waited patiently for
  perfect composition nor looked for interesting framing with other elements in
  the frame.  The whole process took him just a couple of minutes.

<p>And with the amount of automation in mobile phones, the tourist had no
  creative input into the settings of the camera or post-processing steps.  And
  despite all that, the photo is covered by the copyright.


<h2>The prompter</h2>

<p>Compare that to someone entering prompt into a text-to-image tool such as
  Stable Diffusion.  There are countless possibilities of subjects to create
  images of.  Flock of birds in the sea?  Why not weyr of dragons in space? Or
  giant frogs on stills devouring humans?  Similarly there are many options for
  framing.  Is the subject of the image seen from the ground? From above? Are
  there foreground elements which obscure the subject?

<p>And on top of that came all the settings that need to be tweaked to produce
  half-decent AI-generated image.  Multiple models to choose from, samplers,
  guidance scale, control nets and so on.


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>AI is a controversial topic; there are many aspects of it that can lead to
  heated discussions.  It’s not clear whether using publicly-available data to
  train the models is fair use or not.  It’s also not clear whether a model
  which can reproduce letter-for-letter copyrighted works isn’t infringing in
  the first place.

<p>Similarly copyrightability issue is hardly settled.  The registration request
  for ‘A Recent Entrance to Paradise’ doesn’t tell us much since it claimed
  computer as the author.  And in case of ‘Théâtre D’opéra Spatial’, the US
  Copyright Office did ‘not foreclose Mr Allen’s ability to file a new
  application for registration of the Work in which he disclaims the Work’s
  AI-generated material. In such a case, the Office could consider whether the
  human-authored elements of the Work can sustain a claim for copyright, an
  issue we have not decided here.’ Similarly, Leonard French theorised in his
  video that ‘maybe there is a point where an AI generated work could be
  protectable if there was enough creative human input on the input side or if
  you did that on the output side and created something <em>with</em> the
  AI-generated work.’

<p>We’re many lawsuits away from having a clear picture of what kind of
  AI-generated works will be covered by copyright, but the position that photos
  made with a phone can be protected while images created with generative models
  cannot is inconsistent.  The latter entails a lot more creativity and skill
  than majority of copyrighted photographs taken each day around the world.


<aside class=f role=doc-endnotes>

<p id=f1><a href=#b1>1</a> A notable difference is that Dr Thaler didn’t claim
  he was the author of the work.  Rather, he argued that he hired the Creativity
  Machine to produce the images.  Since copyright protections require human
  creativity, the outcome of the registration attempt was doomed to fail from
  the onset.  I may be reading too much into it, but my guess is that Dr Thaler
  was more interested in exploring the idea of machines being creative and
  authoring works rather than getting copyright protections for the image.
