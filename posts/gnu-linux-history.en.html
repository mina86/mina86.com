<p>This article was prepared as presentation for my English class and
since I made it I thought to put it on my homepage.  As presentation
it was not <i>designed</i> to read so please excuse me for lousy
language.  Moreover, I don't claim that it presents the whole history
nor that it is the best source of information, however someone may
find it useful.

<h2 id=printer>The printer</h2>

<p>Once upon a time <a rel=nofollow
href=https://www.csail.mit.edu>Artificial Intelligence Laboratory</a>
(AI Lab) at <a rel=nofollow href=http://www.mit.edu>Massachusetts
Institute of Technology</a> (MIT) got a prototype of a new Xerox 9700
laser printer, which printed pages faster and in higher quality then
the old printer used at the lab.  Unfortunately, it turned out that it
tended to get jammed.

<p>Engineers at the lab quickly realised that, because it was
a modified version of a xerox machine, it was designed to work with
a supervisor how could quickly solve any problems, however, after
modification it worked as a network machine so noöne stood next to it
to make sure everything went fine.

<p>The previous printer that had been used at the lab (the XGP,
Xerographic Printer) had similar bug and a simple <i>hack</i> had been
applied to its software to solve it — when the printer got jammed it
noticed everyone who had jobs on the queue so eventually someone would
come and examine the problem.  This solution did the job, so
<a href=https://stallman.org>Richard M. Stallman</a> decided to do the
same thing with the new printer.

<p>He started looking for the source code of printer’s software,
however, it turned out that there was no human-readable version
available.  Stallman had never encountered situation when source code
of an application is unavailable before, nevertheless he hoped that
someone who used the same printer had decoded the software’s binaries
and made it available.

<p>He remembered that when AI Lab needed a new network controlling
software instead of writing everything from stretch they took a copy
of tools written at Harvard university, modified it a bit and with
small effort made it work in their laboratory.  They also fixed some
bugs so Harvard could benefit from this as well.

<p>Stallman soon realised that it won’t be easy to get to printer’s
software’s source code (he even met a programmer who worked on
printer’s software at Xerox but could not give him the code) because
of a new kind of contract called <i>non disclosure agreement</i> (or
NDA for short) which prevented programmers from revealing information
about software they develop.

<p>Now, think of a software as a recipe.  They are very similar since
recipe gives steps you have to follow to get some kind of result.
Software is the same — it takes some steps to accomplish a task.  In
real life you use recipe, share them with your friends who can then
change it so that they like the meal better.  Now, imagine a world
where you cannot share your recipe.  Where you cannot even modify it,
so there is some kind of dictator who decide how given meal tastes and
you cannot do anything about it even if you think the meal would be
better with a little more garlic.  That’s what software licenses made
to software — you cannot modify proprietary software to fit your needs
and you cannot even share it with your friends.

<p>If you really want to you can blame
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates>Bill Gates</a> for
that because he was on of the pioneers of proprietary software model.
On February 3, 1976, he wrote
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Letter_to_Hobbyists
title="Open Letter to Hobbyists">an open letter</a> in
a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_Computer_Club>Homebrew
Computer Club</a> (formed by a group of hackers and computer
hobbyists) Newsletter.  The main point of the letter was that noöne
will work for free to produce a good quality software.  Example he
pointed was his own BASIC application used by many people who did not
pay for it which made time spent on developing Altair BASIC worth less
than two dollars per hour.

<h2 id=gnu>The GNU project</h2>

<p>On September 27, 1983 Richard Stallman announced on the
net.unix-wizards and net.usoft newsgroups that he’s going to write
a free operating system which will be compatible with Unix OSes.
Later on, on January 5, 1984, he quits his job at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology so that they could not claim ownership or
interfere with distributing <a href=https://www.gnu.org>GNU</a> as free
software.

<p>The goal was to bring a wholly free software operating system into
existence.  Stallman wanted computer users to be free, as most were in
the 1960s and 1970s: free to study the source code of the software
they use, free to share the software with other people, free to modify
the behaviour of the software, and free to publish their modified
versions of the software.  This philosophy was published in March 1985
as <a href=https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.html>the GNU
Manifesto</a>.

<p>Also in 1985, Stallman invented and popularized the concept of
<a href=https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/copyleft.html>copyleft</a>,
a legal mechanism to protect the modification and redistribution
rights for free software.  It was first implemented in the GNU Emacs
General Public License, and in 1989 the first program-independent
<a href=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>GNU General Public
License</a> (GPL) was released.

<p>As there wasn’t many free software in 1980s, much of the needed
tools had to be written from scratch, but existing compatible free
software components were used.  Two examples were the
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX>TeX typesetting system</a>,
and the <a href=https://www.x.org>X Window System</a>.  Most of GNU has
been written by volunteers; some in their spare time, some paid by
companies, educational institutions, and other non-profit
organisations.  In October 1985, Stallman set up the
<a href=https://www.fsf.org>Free Software Foundation</a> (FSF).  In the
late 1980s and 1990s, the FSF hired software developers to write the
software needed for GNU.

<p>As GNU gained prominence, interested businesses began contributing
to development or selling GNU software and technical support.  The
most prominent and successful of these was
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_Solutions>Cygnus Solutions
funded</a> in 1989, now part of <a rel=nofollow
href=https://www.redhat.com>Red Hat</a>.

<h2 id=kernel>Missing kernel</h2>

<p>By 1990, the GNU system had an extensible text editor (Emacs),
a very successful optimising compiler (GCC), and most of the core
libraries and utilities of a standard Unix distribution.

<p>The main component still missing was the kernel.  In the GNU
Manifesto, Stallman had mentioned that “an initial kernel exists but
many more features are needed to emulate Unix.”  He was referring to
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trix_(operating_system)>TRIX</a>,
a remote procedure call kernel developed at MIT, whose authors had
decided to distribute it as free software, and was compatible with
Version 7 Unix.  In December 1986, work had started on modifying this
kernel.  However, the developers eventually decided it was unusable as
a starting point, primarily because it only ran on “an obscure,
expensive 68000 box” and would therefore have to be ported to other
architectures before it could be used.

<p>The GNU Project’s early plan was to adapt the
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD>BSD</a> 4. 4-Lite kernel for
GNU.  Thomas Bushnell, the initial
<a href=https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd.html>Hurd</a> architect
said in hindsight that “It is now perfectly obvious to me that this
would have succeeded splendidly and the world would be a very
different place today”.  However, due to a lack of coöperation from
the Berkeley programmers, the <a rel=nofollow
href=https://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/mach/public/www/mach.html>Mach</a>
message-passing kernel being developed at <a rel=nofollow
href=https://cs.cmu.edu>Carnegie Mellon University</a> was being
considered instead, although its release as free software was delayed
until 1990 while its developers worked to remove code copyrighted to
AT&amp;T.

<h2 id=linux>The Linux kernel</h2>

<p>At the same time,
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds>Linus Torvalds</a>
at <a rel=nofollow href=https://www.cs.helsinki.fi>University of
Helsinki</a> started creating an operating systems for Intel
architecture.  He announced that in September 1991 in a notice posted
to comp.os.minix newsgroup.  Soon the first 0.01 version of Linux was
released.

<p>Torvaldds himself have chosen the name <i>Freax</i> which combines
<i>free</i>, <i>freak</i> and the obligatory <i>x</i> since it was a
Unix-like system.  However, the person who put source codes on the
FTP site didn’t like the name and put them in directory called Linux
and so the name stayed.

<p>At the beginning Linux was developed under stricter conditions then
those imposed by GNU General Public License.  In particular it could
not be used sold.  Quickly, however, the license was changed to the
GNU GPL.

<p>Because more and more people played with the Linux kernel (Linus
Torvalds describes that in 1992 it was no longer he and a couple of
friends but he and hundred people who he didn’t know where they live
or who they are) some tried to find a software that would run on it.
They soon found the GNU system which perfectly matched the kernel
forming the complete operating system, unfortunately they didn’t
realise that it was a GNU system and in turn started calling the whole
thing <i>Linux</i> which made it more difficult to get people
attention to the GNU project and the idea behind it.

<p>Because of that Richard Stallman advocates use of
a term <i>GNU/Linux</i> which points out that it’s not
just <i>Linux</i> but it also contains the GNU software.  He also
advocates to read it with <i>GNU slash Linux</i> since <i>GNU
Linux</i> could give an impression that Linux is a GNU software
package.

<h2 id=apachee>Killer app</h2>

<p>To become popular GNU/Linux needed a killer app which will brought
the new operating system to light and make it available for business.

<p>In 1994 development of <a rel=nofollow
href=http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu>National Center for Supercomputing
Applications</a> web server, known simply as
NCSA <abbr title="HyperText Transfer Protocol Daemon"
lang=en>HTTPd</abbr>, stalled leaving a variety of patches for
improvements circulating through e-mails.
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_McCool>Rob McCool</a> and
several other developers decided to take all available patches and
continue development.  They chose
<a href=https://www.apache.org>Apache</a> as a name because it started
as a set of patches, that is it is <i>a patchy</i> web server.

<p>At the same time, Internet becomes more and more popular.  All new
<abbr title="Internet Service Provider" lang=en>ISP</abbr> companies
a web server and it turned out that GNU/Linux with Apache installed
was a stable and cost effective alternative to Windows NT
with <abbr title="Internet Information Services" lang=en>IIS</abbr> or
Netscape Communications Corporation web server.  For instance, ISP
could host many web pages on a single machine which wasn’t possible
with commercial solutions.

<h2 id=big>Big companies</h2>

<p>Later on, in late 1990s a browser war begun.  Netscape
Communication Corporation with their
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Navigator>Netscape
Navigator</a> thought against <a rel=nofollow
href=https://microsoft.com>Microsoft</a> with their Internet Explorer
to gain dominance in web browser market.  It was really important for
Netscape not to lose this war because otherwise Microsoft with
monopoly could modify <abbr title="HyperText Transfer Protocol"
lang=en>HTTP</abbr> and <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language"
lang=en>HTML</abbr> witch would make Netscape’s web server
incompatible with the mostly used web browser and web server was where
Netscape really earned money.

<p>At the time Netscape Navigator was a closed source application even
though it was available free of charge.  The idea of releasing the
source code, however, was present in the company.

<p>Finally, on January 22, 1995 Netscape Communication released its
browser source code giving the new browser the name
<a href=https://www.mozilla.org>Mozilla</a> web browser.  It was
another important step in GNU/Linux history since Netscape was the
first big company which invested in the idea of free software.  It
gave GNU/Linux visibility and credibility with investors.

<h2 id=open>Open Source</h2>

<p>Some of the developers felt that the term <i>Free Software</i> is
not good for business.  It didn’t help GNU/Linux to spread.  The term
was either connected with a <i>free as in beer</i> and therefore
probably worthless software or with Richard Stallman who had
criticised copyright and intellectual property and (even though he was
never against business) wasn’t really liked with businessmen.

<p>In the early 1995, in the VA Linux office in Mountain View a new
term was introduced — <i>Open Source</i> software.  Its focus was in
practical advantages of <i>open source</i>, that is the cost
effectiveness, instant peer review and possibility to modify
application in such a way that it fits your needs best.  Soon an
<a rel=nofollow href=http://opensource.org/docs/osd>Open Source
Definition</a> (based on
<a href=http://www.debian.org/social_contract>The Debian Free Software
Guidelines</a>) was created witch pointed rules which software have to
meet to be called an Open Source software and an <a rel=nofollow
href=http://opensource.org>Open Source Initiative</a> (or OSI for
short) was funded to spread the idea of Open Source Software.

<h2 id=community>The community</h2>

<p>Richard Stallman criticises the new term and the new Open Source
movement.  He does agree with arguments stated but he believes that
there is something more important in Free Software than creating high
quality tools.  He believes that the freedom to share and modify, that
the advantages for the community are more important than the practical
benefits.

<p>It’s a bit sad that the man who started everything doesn’t really
have attention he deserves.  Even more so since ideas he believes in
are really noble and he cares about community more than other Open
Source developers.

<h2 id=candy>Candy</h2>

<p>When we were in elementary school, teachers touched us to
share — if you bring a candy share it with others.  Now however, we
are told that sharing is bad — if you bring a piece of software do not
share it because it’s stealing.  World will be a much worse place if
we stop sharing candies or lending sugar to your neighbour…
