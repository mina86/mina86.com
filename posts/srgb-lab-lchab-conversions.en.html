<p>After writing about <a href="/2019/srgb-xyz-conversion/">conversion between
  sRGB and XYZ</a> colour spaces I’ve been asked about a related process: moving
  between sRGB and CIELAB (perhaps better known as L*a*b*).  As this may be of
  interest to others, I’ve decided to go ahead and make an article out of it.
  I’ll also touch on <abbr>CIELC</abbr>h<sub>ab</sub> which is a closely related
  colour representation.

<p>The L*a*b* colour space was intended to be perceptually uniform.  While it’s
  not truly uniform it’s nonetheless useful and widely used in the industry.
  For example, it’s the basis of the ΔE*<sub>00</sub> colour difference metric.
  LCh<sub>ab</sub> aim to make L*a*b* easier to interpret by replacing a* and b*
  axes with more intuitive chroma and hue parameters.

<p>Importantly, the conversion between sRGB and L*a*b* goes through XYZ colour
  space.  As such, the full process has multiple steps with a round trip
  conversion being: sRGB​→​XYZ​→​L*a*b*​→​XYZ​→​sRGB.  Because of that structure I will
  describe each of the steps separately.

<!-- EXCERPT -->


<h2>sRGB to XYZ</h2>

<p>For brevity I’ll assume herein that we’re working with 8-bit colour depth,
  i.e. that red, green and blue components are integers in the \(\{0..255\}\)
  range.  This does not need to be true in general and in cases when this
  differs the equations presented herein need to be adjusted accordingly.

<p>When doing any conversions from sRGB, we first need to recall that it
  uses <a href="/2019/srgb-xyz-conversion/">gamma correction</a>.  Each
  component of the colour is <dfn>compressed</dfn> and needs to
  be <dfn>expanded</dfn> to move to linear RGB space.  Only
  then <a href="/2019/srgb-xyz-matrix/">the conversion matrix</a> \(M\) can be
  used to switch from linear RGB to XYZ.  Having an \(\langle r_8, g_8, b_8
  \rangle\) colour, the following formualæ may be used to get corresponding XYZ
  coordinates:

  $$ \begin{align}
    \begin{bmatrix}X \\ Y \\ Z\end{bmatrix}
             &= M \begin{bmatrix}R \\ G \\ B\end{bmatrix} \\[.5em]

    R        &= g_e(r_8) \qquad \\
    G        &= g_e(g_8) \qquad \\
    B        &= g_e(b_8) \qquad \\[.5em]

    g_e(c_8) &= \begin{cases}
      {c_8 \over 3294.6}                              & \text{if } c_8 ≤ 10 \\
      \left({c_8 + 14.025 \over 269.025}\right)^{2.4} & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases} \\[.5em]

    \langle r_8, g_8, b_8 \rangle &∈ \{0 .. 255\}^3
  \end{align} $$

<p>Expressing all that in code, specifically Rust, we get:

<pre>
/// Converts sRGB colour given as a triple of 8-bit integers
/// into XYZ colour space (with white’s Y value equal 1).
fn xyz_from_srgb(srgb: [u8; 3]) -> [f32; 3] {
    // Gamma expansion for 8-bit sRGB components.
    fn gamma_expansion(value255: u8) -> f32 {
        return if value255 &lt;= 10 {
            value255 as f32 / 3294.6
        } else {
            ((value255 as f32 + 14.025) / 269.025).powf(2.4)
        }
    }

    // Convert all components to linear RGB.
    let r = gamma_expansion(srgb[0]);
    let g = gamma_expansion(srgb[1]);
    let b = gamma_expansion(srgb[2]);

    // Switch to XYZ.
    [
        r*0.4124108464885388   + g*0.3575845678529519  + b*0.18045380393360833,
        r*0.21264934272065283  + g*0.7151691357059038  + b*0.07218152157344333,
        r*0.019331758429150258 + g*0.11919485595098397 + b*0.9503900340503373,
    ]
}
</pre>

<p>As mentioned, when working with different colour depths a different \(g_e\)
  or <code>gamma_expansion</code> function is necessary.  It’s <em>not</em>
  enough to scale all numbers since the \(c_8 ≤ 10\) condition has been chosen
  specifically to work with 8-bit integers.  The base formula — for normalised
  RGB components in the \([0, 1]\) range — and further discussion of this topic
  is present in the aforementioned article
  on <a href="/2019/srgb-xyz-conversion/">gamma correction</a>.


<h2>XYZ to L*a*b*</h2>

<p>While the sRGB standard defines a white point — which is incorporated into
  the conversion matrix — CIELAB can be used with different illuminants.  For
  simplicity, I’m going to assume the same reference — standard illuminant
  D<sub>65</sub> — that sRGB uses and which is widely used when working with
  emissive displays.  If necessary that can be easily adjusted by changing
  \(X_r\), \(Y_r\) and \(Z_r\) values below to those corresponding to one’s
  favourite white point.  With all that said, equations for calculating L*a*b*
  coordinates for a colour given in XYZ space are as follows:

  $$ \begin{align}
    L^*  &= 116 f_y - 16    \\
    a^*  &= 500 (f_x - f_y) \\
    b^*  &= 200 (f_y - f_z) \\[.5em]

    f_x  &= f(X / X_r) \\
    f_y  &= f(Y / Y_r) \\
    f_z  &= f(Z / Z_r) \\[.5em]

    f(v) &= \begin{cases}
      (κ v + 16) / 116 & \text{if }v ≤ ε \\
      \sqrt[3]{v}      & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases} \\[.5em]

    ε &= {216 \over 24389} \\
    κ &= {24389 \over 27} \\[.5em]

    X_r &= 0.9504492182750991 \\
    Y_r &= 1 \\
    Z_r &= 1.0889166484304715
  \end{align} $$

<p>Translating the formulæ into code yields:

<pre>
/// Converts colour from XYZ space to CIELAB (a.k.a. L*a*b) using
/// D65 reference white point.
fn lab_from_xyz(xyz: [f32; 3]) -> [f32; 3] {
    const EPSILON: f32 = 216.0 / 24389.0;
    const KAPPA: f32 = 24389.0 / 27.0;

    fn f(v: f32) -> f32 {
        if v > EPSILON {
            v.powf(1.0 / 3.0)
        } else {
            (KAPPA * v + 16.0) / 116.0
        }
    }

    let fx = f(xyz[0] / 0.9504492182750991);
    let fy = f(xyz[1]);
    let fz = f(xyz[2] / 1.0889166484304715);

    [
        116.0 * fy - 16.0,
        500.0 * (fx - fy),
        200.0 * (fy - fz),
    ]
}
</pre>


<h2>L*a*b* to XYZ</h2>

<p>Conversion from L*a*b* to sRGB involves performing all the steps in reverse
  order.  First going from CIELAB to XYZ, then to linear RGB and finally to
  sRGB.  The first step of this process is governed by the following equations:

  $$ \begin{align}
    X           &= f^{-1}(f_x) X_r \\
    Y           &= f^{-1}(f_y) Y_r \\
    Z           &= f^{-1}(f_z) Z_r \\[.5em]

    f_y         &= {(L^* + 16) \over 116} \\
    f_x         &= {a^* \over 500} + f_y \\
    f_z         &= f_y - {b^* \over 200} \\[.5em]

    f^{-1}(v)   &= \begin{cases}
      v^3              & \text{if }v > \sqrt[3]{ε} \\
      (116 v − 16) / κ & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases} \\[.5em]

    \sqrt[3]{ε} &= \sqrt[3]{216 \over 24389} = {6 \over 29}
  \end{align} $$

<p>To optimise calculations it’s also worth to observe that:

  $$ \begin{align}
    f^{-1}(f_y) &= \begin{cases}
      f_y^3    & \text{if }(L^* + 16) / 116 > \sqrt[3]{ε} \\
      (116 (L^* + 16) / 116 − 16) / κ & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases} \\
    &= \begin{cases}
      f_y^3   & \text{if }L^* > 116\sqrt[3]{ε}-16 \\
      L^* / κ & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases} \\
    116\sqrt[3]{ε}-16 &= 116{6 \over 29} - 16 = 8
  \end{align} $$

<p>Taking that optimisations into consideration, the equations translate into
  the following Rust function:

<pre>
/// Converts colour from CIELAB (a.k.a. L*a*b) space
/// using D65 reference white point to XYZ.
fn xyz_from_lab(lab: [f32; 3]) -> [f32; 3] {
    const CBRT_EPSILON: f32 = 0.20689655172413796;
    const KAPPA: f32 = 24389.0 / 27.0;

    fn f_inv(v: f32) -> f32 {
        if v > CBRT_EPSILON: {
            v.powi(3)
        } else {
            (v * 116.0 - 16.0) / KAPPA
        };
    }

    let fy = (lab[0] + 16.0) / 116.0;
    let fx = (lab[1] / 500.0) + fy;
    let fz = fy - (lab[2] / 200.0);

    let x = f_inv(fx) * 0.9504492182750991;
    let y = if lab[0] > 8 {
        fy.powi(3)
    } else {
        lab[0] / KAPPA
    }
    let z = f_inv(fz) * 1.0889166484304715;

    [x, y, z]
}
</pre>


<h2>XYZ to sRGB</h2>

<p>The second step is moving to sRGB colour space.  Similarly to conversion in
  the other direction, this involves switching from XYZ to linear RGB first (by
  using the inverse conversion matrix) and then applying gamma compression
  function to get final sRGB coordinates.

  $$ \begin{align}
    r_8    &= g_c(R) \\
    g_8    &= g_c(G) \\
    b_8    &= g_c(B) \\[.5em]

    \begin{bmatrix}R \\ G \\ B\end{bmatrix}
           &= M^{-1} \begin{bmatrix}X \\ Y \\ Z\end{bmatrix}^T \\[.5em]

    g_c(s) &= g_e^{-1}(s) \\
           & = \begin{cases}
                 ⌊3294.6 s⌉                   & \text{if } s ≤ S_0 \\
                 ⌊269.025 s^{1/2.4} - 14.025⌉ & \text{otherwise}
               \end{cases} \\
    S_0 &= 0.00313066844250060782371
  \end{align} $$

<p>Like before, this assumes 8-bit colour depth output.  For general form of the
  \(g_c\) function which can be adjusted to other depths see discussion in
  the <a href="/2019/srgb-xyz-conversion/">sRGB↔XYZ conversion</a> article.  In
  the meanwhile, the above formulæ expressed in code take the following form:

<pre>
/// Converts colour given in XYZ colour space (with white’s Y value
/// equal 1) into an sRGB colour specified as a triple of 8-bit integers.
fn srgb_from_xyz(xyz: [f32; 3]) -> [u8; 3] {
    // Gamma compression from linear [0, 1] value to 8-bit integer.
    fn gamma_compression(linear: f32): u8 {
        let v = if linear &lt;= 0.00313066844250060782371 {
            3294.6 * linear
        } else {
            269.025 * linear.pow(5.0 / 12.0) - 14.025
        };
        v.round().min(255.0).max(0.0) as u8
    }

    let x = xyz[0];
    let y = xyz[1];
    let z = xyz[2];

    let r = x* 3.240812398895283    - y*1.5373084456298136  - z*0.4985865229069666;
    let g = x*-0.9692430170086407   + y*1.8759663029085742  + z*0.04155503085668564;
    let b = x* 0.055638398436112804 - y*0.20400746093241362 + z*1.0571295702861434;

    [
        gamma_compression(r),
        gamma_compression(g),
        gamma_compression(b),
    ]
}
</pre>

<p>And that’s it as far as converting between L*a*b* and sRGB colour spaces is
  concerned.  With the presented code, <code>lab_from_xyz(xyz_from_srgb([r, g,
  b]))</code> gets an sRGB colour converted into L*a*b*
  and <code>srgb_from_xyz(xyz_from_lab([l, a, b]))</code> moves in the opposite
  direction.  There’s still a closely related colour
  representation — <abbr>CIEL</abbr>Ch<sub>ab</sub> or LCh<sub>ab</sub> — which
  we’ll look at next.


<h2>L*a*b* and LCh<sub>ab</sub></h2>

<p>The a* and b* components of the L*a*b* colour are not easy to interpret.
  Even knowing that they component represents green-red and blue-yellow axes
  respectively, it’s tricky to visualise the colour space.  To make it easier
  for humans to work with, CIE defined an LCh<sub>ab</sub> colour space as
  a conversion of L*a*b* into a cylindrical coordinate system.  It replaces a*
  and b* components with more intuitive chroma and hue.  The relations between
  all the components is as follows:

  $$ \begin{align}
    C^* &= \sqrt{a^{*2} + b^{*2}}  \\
    h   &= \text{atan}_2(b^*, a^*) \\[.5em]
    a^* &= C^* \cos(h)             \\
    b^* &= C^* \sin(h)
  \end{align} $$

<p>Depending on use case it may be better to keep hue expressed in radians or to
  convert it to degrees.  The former is usually easier for computation since
  mathematical instructions typically operate in radians.  On the other hand,
  the latter is more intuitive as it’s easier to think in degrees than radians.

<p>Below are the formulæ expressed in code with conversion to degrees present:

<pre>
/// Converts colour given in CIELAB (a.k.a. L*a*b) space to
/// CIELCh(ab) with hue expressed in degrees.
fn lch_from_lab(lab: [f32; 3]) -> [f32; 3] {
    [
        lab[0],
        lab[1].hypot(lab[2]),
        lab[2].atan2(lab[1]) * 360.0 / std::f32::consts::TAU,
    ]
}

/// Converts colour given in CIELCh(ab) space with hue
/// expressed in degrees to CIELAB (a.k.a. L*a*b*).
fn lab_from_lch(lch: [f32; 3]) -> [f32; 3] {
    let h_rad = lch[2] * std::f32::consts::TAU / 360.0;
    [
        lch[0],
        lch[1] * h_rad.cos(),
        lch[1] * h_rad.sin(),
    ]
}
</pre>


<h2>Accuracy benchmark and possible improvements</h2>

<p>To finish up, let’s test just how good the presented code is.  It’s not easy
  to benchmark precision of the calculations in the conversion code.  There is
  no authoritative set of colours with their coordinates given in RGB and L*a*b*
  colour spaces.  Still, there is one thing that’s easy to check.

<p>Colours with a* and b* components equal to zero represent shades of grey.  In
  other words, for any \(c\), \(\langle c, c, c \rangle\) sRGB colour converted
  to L*a*b* should have its last two components equal zero with L* going from
  zero (for black) and a hundred (for white).  That is, of course, so long as
  the L*a*b* uses D65 reference white point.  This observation allows a simple
  benchmark to be written as follows:

<pre>
fn main() {
    let mut count: usize = 0;
    let mut error: f64 = 0.0;
    let mut max: f32 = 0.0;
    for i in 0..256 {
        let lab = lab_from_xyz(xyz_from_srgb([i as u8, i as u8, i as u8]));
        if lab[1] != 0.0 || lab[2] != 0.0 {
            eprintln!("{:3} {:20} {:20} {:20}", i, lab[0], lab[1], lab[2]);
            count += 1;
            error = (lab[1] as f64).mul_add(lab[1] as f64, error);
            error = (lab[2] as f64).mul_add(lab[2] as f64, error);
            max = max.max(lab[1].abs());
            max = max.max(lab[2].abs());
        }
    }
    println!("{:3} {}e-9 {}e-6", count, error * 1e9, max * 1e6);
}
</pre>

<p>When executed the code shows that 48 colours weren’t converted correctly with
  the maximum error of less than 30 millionth and total square error of less
  than 21 billionth.  With floating point numbers some imprecision is always to
  be expected so this isn’t a bad result by no means.  However, on architectures
  with fused multiply-add instruction accuracy can be improved by improving the
  matrix multiplications at the end of <code>xyz_from_srgb</code> and at the
  beginning of <code>srgb_from_xyz</code> function.  I’ll leave that as an
  exercise to the reader.
