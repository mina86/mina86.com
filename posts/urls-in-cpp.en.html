<p>Documenting source code is important part of software engineering.  Code is
  read more often than itâ€™s written making it crucial to provide enough context
  for reader to understand what the implementation is doing.  This can come in
  the form of links to external resources providing description of an algorithm,
  reference for an API or historic context justifying the code.

<p>As it turns out, C and C++ languages offer a little-known feature which
  allows URLs to be included directly in the function source code.  For example:

<pre>
static float rsqrt(float x) {
	<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root</a>
	static_assert(std::numeric_limits&lt;float>::is_iec559);
	auto i = std::bit_cast&lt;uint32_t>(x) >> 1;
	auto y = std::bit_cast&lt;float>(UINT32_C(0x5F375A86) - i);
	y *= 1.5f - x * 0.5F * y * y;
	return y;
}
</pre>
