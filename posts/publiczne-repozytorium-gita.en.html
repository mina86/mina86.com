<p>And finally, after doing some paper work,
I’ve created <a href="https://github.com/mina86">a set of public git
repositories</a> with various <i>stuff</i> written by me. At the
moment, the most interesting is probably
a <a href="https://github.com/mina86/dot-files/tree/master">dot-files</a>
repository which contains my configuration files — hope someone’ll
find it useful.
