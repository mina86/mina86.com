<p>Don’t you hate when you need to do something you had done before,
but cannot remember how exactly?  I’ve been in that situation several
times and sometimes looking up for a correct method turned out
considerably harder than it should.  To alleviate the need for future
Googling, here’s a bag of notes I can reference easily:

<h2 id=chrome>Getting past Chrome certificate error</h2>

<p>Chrome does not let people go to websites with invalid certificates.  Proper web browsers usually have an ‘I know, get me there anyway’ button, but Chrome makes this option a little more hidden. If you ever find a need to visit a site without valid certificate, on the Chrome error message screen <b>type ‘proceed’</b> or if that does not work <b>type ‘danger’</b>. Which word needs to by typed depends on kind of error I think. Whatever, just try both.

<h2 id=gitgc>‘Compressing’ git repository</h2>

<p>By now everyone should know that the <code>--aggressive</code> flag of <code>git gc</code> is not to be used. In general git should handle pack file effectively, but what if you <em>really</em> want to try and squeeze every byte out of it?

<pre>git repack -a -d --depth=1000 --window=1000</pre>

<p>The numbers are arguably an overkill (and back in 2007
    <a href=http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2007-12/msg00165.html>Linus
    Torvalds suggested</a> 250 for both instead) but today’s machines
    are usually fast enough to handle them.  The flip side is that
    past few hundreds you’re reaching diminishing returns.

<h2 id=author>Changing commit author</h2>

<p>On the topic of git, to change author of a commit simply run:

<pre>git commit --amend --author "Jane Doe &lt;jane@doe.com&gt;"</pre>

<p>(Yeah, I know, this is obvious, but I keep forgetting that <code>--author</code> option exists).</p>

<h2 id=letter>How to start a letter in English</h2>

<p>This one is hard to find because the Internet is filled with pages that give too much information where all I need to know is proper salutation and valediction.  Here it is: If you <strong>do not know</strong> the name of the person you are writing to:

<blockquote><p>Dear Sir or Madam,
<p>I am writing to inform you of a fire that has broken out on the premises of 123 Cavendon Road…
<p>Yours faithfully,<br>John Smith</blockquote>

<p>If you <strong>know the name</strong> of the person you are writing to:

<blockquote><p>Dear Ms. Doe,
<p>I am writing to inform you of a fire that has broken out on the premises of 123 Cavendon Road…
<p>Yours sincerely,<br>John Smith</blockquote>

<p>Polish speakers might note that — since English has a nonsensical typography and orthography rules — the salutation finishes with a comma even though the next paragraph starts with a capital letter.  In languages which make more sense (e.g. Polish), the salutation is closed with a period.

<h2 id=sum>Summing numbers in a column in Emacs</h2>

<p>Select column containing the numbers to sum and simply invoke <code>C-u C-x * :</code>.
