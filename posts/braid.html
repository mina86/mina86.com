<p>I’ve just finished <a href=http://braid-game.com>Braid</a>.
Not a very impressive achievement, I admit, but just as I finished the
last world (or should I say the first) I immediatelly felt the need to
spread the word about this wonderful game.  (I do need to apologise at
this point for yet another non-technical entry on my blog.)

<p>I probably wouldn’t get myself to writing anything about the game
if I hadn’t seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9y6MYDSAww"
rel=nofollow>Video Games are Art</a> talk by Kellee Santiego of <a
href=http://thatgamecompany.com rel=nofollow>That Game Company</a>,
who, as it turns out, mentions Braid.  (Not that I consider the speech
to be particularly interesting or well presented — on the contrary, in
my opinion it is unstructured with rather poor arguments — but it
somehow stuck in my memory.)

<!-- EXCERPT -->

<p>My first impression of Braid was “yet another Mario clone” but as
I was about to quit, and switch to another position from the <a
href=https://www.humblebundle.com>Humble Indie Bundle</a> #2, I died…
or so I thought since, as it turned out, in Braid you can reverse the
time, hence cannot die.

<p>That was the moment I realised it is something more than just
a standard platform game with puzzles.  Not only the
possibility to control time made the game truly unique (ie. unlike any
other I had played), but it momentarily made an introductory text at
the beginning make sense suggesting there was some story behind it
all.

<p>Half through the game, after mentioning Braid, a friend of mine
recalled that he got bored with it.  At that moment I somehow felt his
point especially since my initial excitement cooled off.  The puzzles
reminded to interest and challenge me though, so I stuck to the game
finishing level after level.

<p>Than again, I wouldn’t be writing about it if it was just a nice
puzzle game, would I?  After all, I haven’t devoted a full entry to
write about <a href=https://worldofgoo.com rel=nofollow>World of
Goo</a> or <a href=http://orange.half-life2.com/portal.html
rel=nofollow>Portal</a>.  Posting my own opinion about every game I’ve
played would be a bit antisocial since we have enough spam on the
Internet.

<p>The last level (prior to epilogue) of Braid was, however, truly
brilliant (in my opinion at least).  It made me go “<em>wow</em>” (and
I do apologise for such a childish vocabulary but I honestly cannot
find words to describe the experience) and suddenly the genius and
simplicity of the level had been revealed filling me with honest
admiration.

<p>It’s not that I’m a hardcore gamer, I don’t play that much, but for
what it’s worth I do recommend Braid.  Honestly.  The game is
immensely satisfactory, extremely inspiring and definitely worth every
penny.

<p>I wish I could play that „awesome Braid”… I have bought the Humble Indie Bundle #2 and am not able to play… the built-in graphics adapter of my laptop (Intel 945GM) cannot handle it. :-(<br />
That is a pity, as the graphics doesn’t look that demanding…</p>

<p>I have to admit that I had similar impression, especially after I was unable to play the game at full screen due to extremely slow rendering.</p>

<p>In fact, I have heard of complains that the PC port of the game was not well optimised for new platform (it was originally an Xbox360 product), which could be even worse on Linux (under which I run the game) since it is the most recent port.</p>

<p>You could try complaining on provided email address -- maybe it’ll be an impulse for the developers to better optimise Braid.</p>

<p>@hook: GM45 provides ‘a bit better’ graphics chip that 945GM… The funniest thing is I started considering buying new laptop because of this game…</p>

<p>Now, that’s a bit extreme. :P I mean buying a new machine just for a single game.</p>

<p>Now I found out it is ‘kind of playable’ with <code>-no_post</code> option… looks awful… but kind of works… ;) though I will probably stuck at some point because of not being able to recognise some scene details…</p>
