<p><code>cd</code> is a straightforward command.  As per the name, it changes
  the directory and does its job perfectly well.  But what if it could do more?
  One scenario is wanting to execute a command inside a specific location
  without affecting the current working directory (CWD).  This article
  introduces a <code>cd</code> replacement which offers that feature as well as
  provides more ways to specify the target directory.

<p>It is important to note that it’s not intended for scripting.  Rather, it’s
  only meant for interactive use where it streamlines some operations.

<h2>New Features</h2>

<p id=b1>For impatient readers, the code
  is <a href="https://github.com/mina86/dot-files/blob/master/bin/pcd.sh">available
  on GitHub</a><sup><a href=#f1>1</a></sup>.  Otherwise, let’s first go
  through the new features of this enhanced <code>cd</code>.

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It takes a command as an optional argument.  The command is launched
      inside of the target directory without changing CWD, for example:
<pre>
<u>~/code/rust-rocksdb/librocksdb-sys$</u> <b>cd .. cargo build</b>
# <i>... builds rust-rocksdb rather than librocksdb-sys</i>
<u>~/code/rust-rocksdb/librocksdb-sys$</u>
</pre>

  <li>
    <p>The target directory can be specified as a file.  The code will change to
      directory containing that file.  This is convenient when copying and
      pasting paths.  A file location can be passed without having to strip the
      last path component, for example (border around text symbolises copying
      and pasting):
<pre>
<u>~/code/linux$</u> <b>git whatchanged -n1 |grep ^:</b>
:100644 100644 8ddb2219a84b 6b384065c013 M	<span style="outline: 1px solid">include/uapi/linux/kd.h</span>
<u>~/code/linux$</u> <b>cd <span style="outline: 1px solid">include/uapi/linux/kd.h</span></b>
<u>~/code/linux/include/uapi/linux$</u>
</pre>

  <li>
    <p>The target directory can be specified using a path starting
      with <code>.../</code>.  The code navigates up the directory tree until
      a matching path is found, for example:
<pre>
<u>~/code/linux/drivers/usb/gadget/udc$</u> <b>cd .../Documentation</b>
<u>~/code/linux/Documentation$</u>
</pre>

  <li>
    <p>The enhancement integrates with Bash’s <code>autocd</code> option.  With
      it enabled, invoking a directory followed by a command executes that
      command inside of said directory, for example:
<pre>
<u>/tmp/bash-5.2$</u> <b>./examples pwd</b>
cd -- ./examples/ pwd
/tmp/bash-5.2/examples
<u>/tmp/bash-5.2$</u>
</pre>

  <li>
    <p><code>cd -P</code> resolves all symlinks in <code>PWD</code>.  I’ve found
      this is more useful than POSIX-mandated behaviour.  For consistency,
      of <code>cd -L</code> also doesn’t switch to home directory.
</ul>


<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>The new <code>cd</code> comes as a shell script which needs to be sourced
  in <code>~/.shellrc</code>, <code>~/.bashrc</code> or equivalent file.

<p>I further recommend adding an alias for <code>-</code> command.  This may
  look strange, but creating a hyphen alias is perfectly fine even though it
  requires some care.  <code>autocd</code> in Bash is also worth a try.

<p>The enhanced <code>cd</code> together with those optional configuration
  options can be installed by executing the following commands:

<pre>
mkdir -p ~/.local/opt
cd ~/.local/opt

# <i>Replace with ‘master’ to get the latest version though</i>
# <i>be warned that there are no guarantees of compatibility</i>
# <i>between the versions.</i>
commit=8ca6070ce2e58581b1aeec748513bbd33904b41d
wget "<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mina86/dot-files/8ca6070ce2e58581b1aeec748513bbd33904b41d/bin/pcd.sh">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mina86/dot-files/${commit?}/bin/pcd.sh</a>"
. pcd.sh

install='
if [ -e ~/.local/opt/pcd.sh ]; then
    . ~/.local/opt/pcd.sh
fi

# <i>Bash interprets ‘-=…’ as a flag so ‘--’ is needed but</i>
# <i>BusyBox complains about it so silence the warning.</i>
alias -- -="cd -" 2>/dev/null
'

# <i>Add to Bash</i>
echo "${install?}"      &gt;&gt;~/.bashrc
echo "shopt -qs autocd" &gt;&gt;~/.bashrc
# <i>Add to other shells</i>
echo "${install?}"      &gt;&gt;~/.shellrc
</pre>


<h2>Limitations</h2>

<p>Firstly, the enhanced command does not support any other switches
  shell’s <code>cd</code> might offer such as <code>-e</code>
  or <code>-@</code>.  Anyone who relies on them should be able to add them to
  the script with relative ease.

<p>Secondly, the command doesn’t fully integrate with <code>CDPATH</code>.
  While basic functionality of <code>CDPATH</code> works, it cannot be combined
  with alternative target directory specification used by the
  new <code>cd</code>.


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>There are commands a seasoned shell user may use without giving them a second
  thought.  Certainly, <code>cd</code> is so obvious and straightforward that
  there’s nothing to change about it.  However, accepting that even fundamental
  commands could be changed may lead to improvements in one’s workflow.

<p>I’ve been using various forms of enhanced <code>cd</code> for over a decade.
  And with this post I hope I’ve inspired you, Dear Reader, to give it a shot as
  well.  The exact set of features may not be to your liking, but nothing stops
  you from writing your own <code>cd</code> replacement.


<p id=f1><a href=#b1>1</a> Note that the repository includes my dot-files and
  I may with time update functionality of the <code>pcd.sh</code> script to the
  point where description in this article is no longer accurate.  This post is
  describing <a href="https://github.com/mina86/dot-files/blob/8ca6070ce2e58581b1aeec748513bbd33904b41d/bin/pcd.sh">version
  at commit 8ca6070c</a>.  Setup instructions in Installation section are pinned
  to that version.
