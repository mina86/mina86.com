<p>Some people find it surprising that zero is an even number.  Turns out it’s
  such a controversial point that Wikipedia’s
  <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_of_zero>article on the
  subject</a> has nearly 5000 words and 75 citations.  That’s ten times as long
  as an entry on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toast_sandwich">toast
  sandwich</a> which is clearly a more important topic.  On the other hand
  perhaps the confusion is to be expected considering that for centuries zero
  has been judged an odd digit (if a digit at all).  Regardless, zero being even
  is not news and this is not what this post is about.

<p>Rather, I wish to share another bit of knowledge.  As it turns out, infinity
  is even.  Who would have thought!  As the working group for the C programming
  language (<abbr>SC22 WC14</abbr>) explains
  in <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/C99RationaleV5.10.pdf">C99
  rationale</a>, ‘all large positive floating-point values are even integers’.

<p>There you go.  Next time your Maths teacher asks what’s -42 to infinite power
  go ahead and exclaim with conviction that it’s plus infinity!  The teacher
  will fail you of course (and rightfully so) unless you’re so lucky that they
  turn out to secretly be an expert on IEEE 754 standard.
