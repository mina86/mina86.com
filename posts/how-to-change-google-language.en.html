<p>Or: How to change language of Google website.

<p>If you’ve travelled abroad, you may have noticed that Google <em>tries</em>
  to be helpful and uses the language of the region you’re in on its websites.
  It doesn’t matter if your operating system is set to Spanish, for example;
  Google Search will still use Portuguese if you happen to be in Brazil.

<p>Fortunately, there’s a simple way to force Google to use a specific language.
  All you need to do is append <code>?hl=<var>lang</var></code> to the website’s
  address, replacing <var>lang</var>
  with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes">a two-letter
  code</a> for the desired language. For
  instance, <a href="https://www.google.com/?hl=es"><code>?hl=es</code></a> for
  Spanish, <a href="https://www.google.com/?hl=ht"><code>?hl=ht</code></a> for
  Haitian, or <a href="https://www.google.com/?hl=uk"><code>?hl=uk</code></a>
  for Ukrainian.

<p>If the URL already contains a question mark, you need to
  append <code>&amp;hl=<var>lang</var></code> instead.  Additionally, if it
  contains a hash symbol, you need to insert the string immediately before the
  hash symbol.  For example:

<ul>
  <li><code>https://www.google.com/<strong>?hl=es</strong></code>
  <li><code>https://www.google.com/search?q=bread+sandwich<strong>&amp;hl=es</strong></code>
  <li><code>https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/<strong>?hl=es</strong>#/report-home/</code>
</ul>

<p>By the way, as a legacy of Facebook having hired many ex-Google employees,
  the parameter also work on some of the Facebook properties.

<p>This trick doesn’t work on all Google properties.  However, it seems to be
  effective on pages that try to guess your language preference without giving
  you the option to override it.  For example, while Gmail ignores the
  parameter, you can change its display language in the settings (accessible via
  the gear icon near the top right of the page).  Similarly, YouTube strips the
  parameter, but it respects preferences configured in the web browser.

<p>Anyone familiar with HTTP may wonder why Google doesn’t simply look
  at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language">the <code>Accept-Language</code>
  header</a>.  Problem is that many users have their browser configured with
  defaults that send English as the only option, even though they would prefer
  another language.  In those cases, it’s more user-friendly to ignore that
  header.  As it turns out, localisation is hard.
