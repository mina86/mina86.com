<p style="text-align: center">Or how to change language of Google website.

<p id=b4>If you’ve travelled abroad you might have noticed Google <em>tries</em>
  to be helpful and uses language of the region you’re in on its websites.  It
  doesn’t matter that your operating system is in, say, Spanish; Google Search
  will still use Portuguese if you happen to be in Brazil.

<p>Fortunately, there’s a way to coerce it into using specific language.  All
  you need to do is append <code>?hl=<var>lang</var></code> to website’s address
  replacing <var>lang</var>
  by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes">a two-letter
  code</a> of the desired language.  For
  instance, <a href="https://www.google.com/?hl=es"><code>?hl=es</code></a> for
  Spanish, <a href="https://www.google.com/?hl=ht"><code>?hl=ht</code></a> for
  Haitian or <a href="https://www.google.com/?hl=uk"><code>?hl=uk</code></a> for
  Ukrainian.

<p>If the URL already contains a question mark, you need to
  append <code>&amp;hl=<var>lang</var></code> instead.  Furthermore, if it
  contains a hash symbol, rather than appending the string, it needs to be
  inserted just prior to the hash.  For example:

<ul>
  <li><code>https://www.google.com/<strong>?hl=es</strong></code>
  <li><code>https://www.google.com/search?q=bread+sandwich<strong>&amp;hl=es</strong></code>
  <li><code>https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/<strong>?hl=es</strong>#/report-home/</code>
</ul>

<p>This doesn’t work on all Google properties.  Thankfully, it seems to do the
  trick where it matters: on pages which try to guess the preference without
  option to override it.  For example, while Gmail ignores the parameter, its
  display language can be changed in its settings (accessible via gear icon near
  the top right of the page).  Similarly, YouTube strips the parameter but it
  respects preferences configured in the web browser.

<p>PS. Anyone familiar with HTTP might wonder why Google doesn’t just look at
  the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language"><code>Accept-Language</code>
  header</a>.  Apparently the issue is that many users have their browser
  configured with defaults of sending English as the only option even though
  they would prefer another language.  In those cases it’s more user-friendly to
  ignore that header.  Turns out localisation is really hard.
