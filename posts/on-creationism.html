<p>I have got involved in a discussion… on YouTube… and about
creationism non less… Yeah, I am still wondering how that happened, but
it did.  In this discussion I was prompted to watch a pro-creationism
video, which I decided to do and comment on it.  This entry is the
result.</p>

<!-- EXCERPT -->

<h2>Prologue: Evolution versus? religion</h2>

<p>Before I start I need to clarify one thing: <em>theory of evolution
does not contradict religion</em>, and I will not try to prove or
disprove existence of God.  I feel (hope) that many people who believe
in creationism do so because they think it is required by their
religion.  Albeit, it cannot be stressed to much that <strong>theory
of evolution does not contradict religion</strong>.</p>

<p>Really, I am serious: <strong style="font-size:1.5em">theory of
evolution does not contradict religion</strong>.</p>

<p>You do not have to take my word on it.  You can see what people far
more competent then I have said (quote and citations taken from <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creationism#Christian_criticism">Wikipedia’s
article on creationism</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many Christians disagree with the teaching of creationism.  Several
  religious organizations, among them the Catholic Church, hold that
  their faith does not conflict with the scientific consensus regarding
  evolution. <a href="https://ncse.com/media/voices/religion">[NCSE]</a>
  The <a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clergy_Letter_Project">Clergy
  Letter Project</a>, which has collected more than 13000 signatures, is
  an <q>endeavor designed to demonstrate that religion and science can
  be compatible</q>.</p>

  <p>In his 2002 article <q>Intelligent Design as a Theological
  Problem</q>, George Murphy argues against the view that life on Earth,
  in all its forms, is direct evidence of God’s act of creation (Murphy
  quotes Phillip Johnson’s claim that he is speaking <q>of a God who
  acted openly and left his fingerprints on all the evidence.</q>).
  Murphy argues that this view of God is incompatible with the Christian
  understanding of God as <q>the one revealed in the cross and
  resurrection of Jesus.</q> The basis of this theology is Isaiah 45:15,
  <q>Truly, thou art a God who hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the
  Savior.</q></p>

  <p>[…]

  <p>For Murphy, a theology of the cross requires that Christians accept
  a methodological naturalism, meaning that one cannot invoke God to
  explain natural phenomena, while recognizing that such acceptance does
  not require one to accept a metaphysical naturalism, which proposes
  that nature is all that there is.</p>

  <p>Other Christians have expressed qualms about teaching creationism.
  In March 2006, Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, the leader of
  the world’s Anglicans, stated his discomfort about teaching
  creationism, saying that creationism was <q>a kind of category
  mistake, as if the Bible were a theory like other theories</q>.  He
  also said: <q>My worry is creationism can end up reducing the doctrine
  of creation rather than enhancing it.</q> The views of the Episcopal
  Church - a major American-based branch of the Anglican Communion - on
  teaching creationism resemble those of Williams. [<a
  href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2006/mar/21/religion.topstories3">The
  Guardian</a>]</p>

  <p>In April 2010 the American Academy of Religion issued Guidelines
  for Teaching About Religion in K‐12 Public Schools in the United
  States which included guidance that creation science or intelligent
  design should not be taught in science classes, as <q>Creation
  science and intelligent design represent worldviews that fall
  outside of the realm of science that is defined as (and limited to)
  a method of inquiry based on gathering observable and measurable
  evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning.</q> However,
  they, as well as other <q>worldviews that focus on speculation
  regarding the origins of life represent another important and
  relevant form of human inquiry that is appropriately studied in
  literature or social sciences courses.  Such study, however, must
  include a diversity of worldviews representing a variety of
  religious and philosophical perspectives and must avoid privileging
  one view as more legitimate than others.</q> [<a
  href="https://ncse.com/news/2010/07/american-academy-religion-teaching-creationism-005712">NCSE</a>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is how Christianity relates to evolution.  What about Islam?
Here is what Khalid Anees, president of the Islamic Society of
Britain, <a
href="http://education.guardian.co.uk/conferences/story/0,,1117752,00.html">had
to say</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Islam also has its own school of Evolutionary
creationism/Theistic evolutionism, which holds that mainstream
scientific analysis of the origin of the universe is supported by the
Qur’an. Many Muslims believe in evolutionary creationism, especially
among Sunni and Shia Muslims and the Liberal movements within
Islam. Among scholars of Islam İbrahim Hakkı of Erzurum who lived in
Erzurum then Ottoman Empire now Republic of Turkey in 18th century is
famous of stating <q>between plants and animals there is sponge, and,
between animals and humans there is monkey</q>.</blockquote>

<p>Let me
repeat: <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnJX68ELbAY">theory
of evolution does not contradict religion</a></em>.  Furthermore,
I consider disproving evolution by reaching to religion as moronic as
disproving existence of God by reaching to science.  It shows
misunderstanding of what religion is.  Religion is not about proof,
it’s about faith.  If you need proof of existence of God, than you are
doing it wrong.  And if you try to disprove God with science, than you
clearly do not understand the concept of faith.</p>

<h2>The video</h2>

<p>With the above disclaimer out of the way, let’s get to <a
rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5sfHz3xyNc">the
video</a>.  The movie is divided into three parts and so in the
following three subsections I will address claims stated in the video
by first quoting from it directly or just indicating what topic I am
referring to.</p>


<h3>Part I: The origin of life</h3>

<blockquote>[Earth] has perfectly designed system incorporating
extremely complex and delicate balances.</blockquote>

<p>Those statements assumes that a planet with properties that could
sustain life could not come to be “on it’s own” or “by chance”.
However, there is nothing to support that assumption.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the movie, narrator says that there are <q>250
billion galaxies, each a home of about 300 billion stars</q>. I do not
know where those numbers came from, but let’s stick to them.  Simple
multiplications gives us 75 sextillion stars (I am
assuming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_and_short_scales">short
scale</a>), or in other words 75 followed by 21 zeros.  Some, maybe
most, of those stars have, likely
multiple, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrasolar_planet">planets
orbiting them</a> (at the time of
writing, <a href="http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/">we have found 778 such
planets</a>).  Having that in mind, it is no longer obvious that
a planet that can sustain life could not show up by chance.</p>


<blockquote>Any of those [galaxies and star] systems work in
accordance to specific laws.</blockquote>

<p>Of course, those laws are called the theory of gravity.
Furthermore, cosmology proposes further theories explaining how exactly
stars, planets and galaxies form.</p>


<blockquote>Millions of different plant and animal species live on
Earth in perfect harmony.</blockquote>

<p>I would not call predators brutally killing and devouring peaceful
plant eaters “harmony”, but let’s stick with the term authors of the
movie have chosen.</p>

<p>There is not much to dispute in the quoted statement other than the
hidden implication that the harmony had to be designed by someone.
However, there is nothing to suggest that is the only option.  In
fact, I strongly believe that the harmony is a must, and it has to
came up on its own for the life to be possible.</p>

<p>Imagine a world where there are only two species: a grass and an
animal which eats that grass.  In the absence of predators this animal
can multiply with no limitations.  At some point, however, there will
be so many of them that they will eat all the grass and thus start
dying out of starvation.</p>

<p>Earth’s ecosystem is much more complex but the same kind of
processes apply.  Furthermore, it is because of the complexity that
the balance is so fragile and can be easily disturbed by human
intervention.</p>

<p>Maid you that this is not some guess work, this is fact that has
been seen in the past <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species">when people
introduced species</a> to ecosystems where they were not present
before.  With lack of natural predators in such environments, invasive
species can threaten biological diversity in the given region.</p>

<p>The harmony does not have to be given from the outside.  Natural
processes exist which guarantee that some kind of harmony is
reached.</p>


<blockquote>Unlike any other known heavenly body […]</blockquote>

<p>Here authors try to prove something by showing that there is no
proof otherwise, or in other words uses <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance">an argument
from ignorance</a>, a kind of argument that the video uses <em>a
lot</em>.</p>

<p>The fact that we cannot find another planet which could sustain
life, does not prove that such a planet does not exist.  In
fact, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler-22b">Kepler-22b</a>
has been found which is in a habitable zone of a star it is
orbiting.</p>


<blockquote>When living things on Earth are to be examined, a manifest
design is to be observed.</blockquote>

<p>As a computer engineer, I can imagine how an even complicated
design can turn up “by chance”.  <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm">evolutionary
algorithms</a> are algorithms which use methods described by the
theory of evolution to solve computational problems.  By applying
a fitness function to a random process of crossover and mutation, such
algorithms can solve real problems, and they are used in real
applications.</p>

<p>It is not limited to purely mathematical problems.  By performing
simulation, engineers can create designs for tangible
solutions, such as what is the most energy efficient way to swim
(ie. that can be used in a boat).</p>

<p>Evolution had 3.6 billion years to form life observed today.  In
such a long time, equipped with proper tools (that is natural
selection), even a seemingly random process can create a vast diversity
of complex life forms.</p>


<blockquote>In fact, he [Darwin] was himself aware of great many facts
that invalidated his theory.  He admitted this in his book in chapter
entitled <q>Difficulties on theory</q>.</blockquote>

<p>Darwin lists in his book various arguments that could be put
against his theory, but he does that to <em>explain why those
arguments are incorrect</em> and thus defend his theory.  To put it in
other words: Darwin <em>did not</em> doubt his theory.</p>


<blockquote>Darwin’s claims</blockquote>

<p>It is true that some of the Darwin’s claims have been shown to be
too simplistic, but that is how science works.  You start with
a simple theory accounting for evidence you have gathered.  With
time, as more and more evidence is collected, some aspects of the
theory are changed, and it becomes more complex and complete.  This
does not mean that the original theory is totally wrong.  Claiming so,
is like saying that <q>Earth is spherical</q> is totally wrong.  Sure,
modern science shows that Earth is not a perfect sphere, but surely
claim that <q>Earth is a spherical</q> is more accurate than claim
that <q>Earth is flat</q>.</p>

<p>Besides, this is a red herring.  We should not look at what someone
claimed over a century ago.  Science does not stand in place, it goes
forward.  What should matter is the current state of science, not one
from 19th century.</p>

<p>For more on what Darwin did or did not say, and why you should not
relay on information from over a century ago, you can see <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0EIsgAG-y8">Darwin said this…
Darwin said that…</a> (potheler54 likes to mock creationists, but if
you look past it, his videos are really informative).</p>


<blockquote>Louis Pasteur […] reached this important conclusions:
<q>[…] Today, there is no circumstance known […]</q>.</blockquote>

<p>You mean Pasteur who lived in 19th century and had to
relay on scientific knowledge from 19th century, claimed
that during <em>his times</em>, there was no known circumstance for
something to happen?  At his time there was no known method of sending
stuff onto Moon’s surface.  Science has progressed since than so could
we move on to what modern science and modern scientists claim?</p>

<p>This kind of reasoning goes on in the video, and not to waste
reader’s time, I will skip those other instances.</p>


<blockquote>Miller obtained a few simple organic molecules by
triggering a reaction among gasses that he claimed would have been
present in primitive Earth atmosphere. […] Later discovery shows that
the gasses use in the experiment were very different from the gasses
that have been present in the early atmosphere.</blockquote>

<p>Please see <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0EIsgAG-y8&amp;t=5m36s">5:36 to
7:10 of already mentioned potheler54’s video</a>, as he addresses
exactly that point, and there’s no point in me repeating that.</p>


<blockquote><q>Today as we leave the 20th century, we still
face the biggest unsolved problem that we had when we entered the
20th century: How did life originate on
Earth?</q></blockquote>

<p>Jeffrey Bada wrote that, so what?  It’s like some particle
physicist saying 12 years ago: <q>Today as we leave the
20th century, we still face the biggest unsolved problem:
How does matter obtain mass?</q> Maybe my analogy is not perfect, but
I hope it shows the point: The fact that science does not have
explanation for something, does not automatically disprove the whole
theory.  Over the years, there were countless phenomenon that science
could not explain, but by continuous rigorous studies, it came with
theories which explained them.</p>


<blockquote>Today, not even the most sophisticated laboratory has been
able to produce a single leaving cell from non-leaving
matter.</blockquote>

<p>Really? A laboratory has not been able to reproduce a process that
took billion of years? Why am I not surprised? The theory of evolution
does not say that life has appear in day, week, year, or even
a century.  Life is estimated to start over a billion years after
formation of Earth.  Therefore, the simplest life forms had a billion
years to form.  There is no reason to expect that this (or similar)
process can be replicated in laboratory.</p>


<h3>Part II: Imaginary mechanisms of evolution</h3>

<blockquote>Natural selection</blockquote>

<p>On the contrary to what the movie claims, with organisms that have
short life spans and thus fast reproduction rates, the evolution into
a separate specie <em>has been observed</em>.  In 1975 a <a
href="https://ncse.com/cej/5/2/new-proteins-without-gods-help">nylon-eating
bacteria</a> has been discovered that must have evolved within 40
years from invention of nylon in 1935.</p>

<p>Another example are <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_species">ring species</a>
which (after Wikipedia) <q>is a connected series of neighbouring
populations, each of which can interbreed with closely sited related
populations, but for which there exist at least two “end” populations
in the series, which are too distantly related to interbreed, though
there is a potential gene flow between each “linked” species.</q>
Please do read Wikipedia article on that topic, as all I can do is
just repeat what is already written there.</p>


<blockquote>The laws of inheritance discovered by the Austrian
botanist Gregor Mendel caused Lamarck’s and Darwin’s assertions to
collapse.  The science of genetics […] proved that it was not acquired
physical treated but only genes that were transmitted to subsequent
generations.</blockquote>

<p>I am getting tired of that… We have been over this already.
Evolution does not happen exactly as Darwin proposed.  The same way as
Earth is not a perfect sphere… Scientific theories are not set in
stone once they are proposed, and they are not absolutely right or
absolutely wrong.  They change over time as new evidence is
discovered.  Newton’s theory is not wrong, it is just inaccurate at
high energy levels, but it is clearly better than Aristotelian
physics.</p>

<p>And as for genetics, did the narrator mean the same genetics that
is used to trace ancestry and relations between species?  The same
genetics that shows <a
href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/08/0831_050831_chimp_genes.html">humans
and chimps are 96% the same</a>?  Authors of the movie did not
hesitate to use genetics when it allegedly supported their statement,
but conveniently forgotten to mention the fact that it also completely
disprove their overall claim.</p>


<blockquote>The theory of evolution now holds that living things are
difference from one another and developed as a result of
mutation.</blockquote>

<p>The video misrepresents <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation">mutation</a> as besides
radiation and mutagenic chemicals, it can also be caused by viruses,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposon">transposons</a> and
plain errors that occur during meiosis or DNA replication.</p>

<p>Furthermore, mutation changes information in DNA and it can be
either beneficial, destructive or neutral.  At one point, human beings got a mutation
that “damaged” a gene responsible for temporalalis, a muscle that
moves the jaw.  As an effect, the muscle did not grow so big and
humans do not have bite as powerful as apes — something that is
clearly a disadvantage, right?  Albeit, no.  Because the muscle is not
so big, there is more space for brain to grow.</p>

<p>On top of that, during mutation genes can be duplicated thus
increasing the amount on information encoded in DNA.  To recap:
mutations do not require external force, and they can make the
individual better or worse adapt to an environment, even if the change
appear to be negative on the first look.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TU-7d06HJSs">Aron Ra gave
a lot of examples of beneficial mutations</a> and to see how new
organs can evolve, please
see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEKyqIJkuDQ">Dawkins
makes an eye</a>.</p>


<h3>Part III: The fossil records</h3>

<blockquote>fossil remains supporting evolution</blockquote>

<p>Just watch <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o92x6AvxCFg">Show me the
intermediate fossils</a> if you want an example of fossil that do
support evolution.</p>


<blockquote>According to the theory [of evolution] the origination of
such diverse living beings took place through minor and successive
variations over long period of times.</blockquote>

<p>That is what Darwin claimed and is only one possibility.  Another
is presented by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuated_equilibrium">Punctuated
equilibrium</a> which states that for the most part, species will not
change much, but when rapid change occur in environment, organism
evolve rapidly.</p>

<p>Imagine an animal which eats tree leafs.  Times are good and there
is a lot of trees so it does not have problems obtaining food.  Every
now and than, an individual with unusually long neck is born, but
because there is plenty of food, there is no advantage in reaching
leafs high on the tree.  Because of this, natural selection does not
favour those individuals and their genes mix with the rest of the
species so that average neck length of the whole population stays
relatively constant.</p>

<p>However, if a sudden environmental change (for instance climate
change) causes most of the trees to die, suddenly long neck is
a desired trait.  Natural selection starts favouring individuals with
long necks and the specie evolves until a state of equilibrium is
reached again.</p>


<blockquote>Moreover, there is no difference between fossils hundreds
of millions of years and their modern descendants.</blockquote>

<p>Again, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o92x6AvxCFg">Show me
the intermediate fossils</a> shows fossil records in which the
difference is clearly seen and reasonably gradual.  The fact that some
species do not change much is not inconsistent with the theory — if
given specie is well adapted to the environment, there is no need for
change (if it’s not broken, don’t fix it).</p>


<blockquote>Evolutionists claim that birds evolved from reptiles by
random mutations.  However reptiles are cold-blooded whereas birds are
warm-blooded.  The bodies of birds are covered with feathers whereas
body of reptile is covered with scales.</blockquote>

<p>Actually, the claim is that birds evolved from <a
href="https://news.discovery.com/animals/dinosaurs-warm-blooded-120628.html">dinosaurs
which were worm-blooded</a>, and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feathered_dinosaur">some had
feathers</a>.</p>

<p>Later narrator goes on listing differences between warious animal
classes based around the theme of <q>I cannot imagine how that could
have happened, therefore it could not have happened</q>.  Such
reasoning is plain stupid — advanced science is rarely intuitive and
the fact that someone cannot imagine something, proves nothing.</p>

<p>But all right, I will bite (a bit):</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrich">Ostrich</a> —
  a flightless bird.  There are <a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flightless_bird">so many of
  them</a> that it is not even shocking.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguinhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin">Penguin</a> —
  a group of flightless birds that are excellent swimmers.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinnipeds">Pinnipeds</a>
  (which, among others, seals belong to) — mammals that are excellent
  swimmers.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphin">Dolphins</a> and
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale">whales</a> — mammals
  that not only are excellent swimmers but die on dry land.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotremes">Monotremes</a> —
  mammels that lay eggs.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat">Bats</a> — mammals
  that can fly.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.livescience.com/animals/080128-mole-rat-pain.html">Naked
  mole rats</a> — mammals that are cold-blooded.</li>

  mammal with scales.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocodile">Crocodile</a> —
  reptile with a four-chamber heart and cerebral cortex.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>Australopithecus and chimpanzee skeletons</blockquote>

<p>Here the movie is a plain lie.  There are plenty important
differences between those two species and you can watch <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMzBmSVlLvs&amp;t=18m45s">from
18:45 to 21:30 of Origins Of Us 1/3 Bones</a> for one, and <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzFrhGVsGco&amp;t=11m40s">around
two minutes of Humanity’s First Steps starting at 11:40</a> for some
more.</p>


<blockquote>Piltdown fossil introduced in England
in 1912.</blockquote>

<p>Piltdown man was a forgery which was exposed in 1953 by
evolutionists themselves, so clearly scientists did not want to keep
forgeries unexposed because those hinders science.  More on the topic
by <a
href="https://www.clarku.edu/~piltdown/map_expose/piltdown_hoax.html">Robert
Todd Carrol</a> and even more by <a
href="http://home.tiac.net/~cri_a/piltdown/piltdown.html">Richard
Harter</a>.</p>


<blockquote>Nebraska man</blockquote>

<p>Nebraska man was a misclassification, which has been later
corrected again by evolutionists themselves.  It has never been widely
accepted (in fact scientists were sceptical about all the claims) as
an ape, lat alone as a human ancestor (Osborne didn’t even claim
that).  As for the drawing, it has not been made by scientists and has
never been meant as an accurate reconstruction, but as a mere
illustration for a magazine.  More on the topic can be found on <a
href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/a_nebraska.html">Talk
Origins</a>.</p>


<blockquote>fossil skulls has been presented as great evidence of
evolution</blockquote>

<p>Some of the skulls were indeed mistakenly classified as our
ancestors, but again this only shows how science works: if new
evidence is discovered that contradicts earlier claims, those claims
are discarded or changed.  If it is shown that given fossil could not
be of a human ancestor, science acknowledges that and moves on.</p>

<p>But why was the movie silent about the fossils that has not been
dismissed?  Like Australopithecus Afarensis, Homo Habilis (first to
use stone tools), Homo Erectus.  I leave you with a <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxrxnPG05SU">scene from
Futurama</a>.</p>


<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<p>And so that was my part in fighting misconceptions.  If you came to
this site already accepting evolution than at least I hope you have
learned something new.  On the other hand, if you did not accept it,
but now have doubts about creationism I encourage you to watch videos
linked from this entry.  If you are still convinced evolution is
wrong… well, I have tried.</p>


<h2>Some more videos</h2>

<p>If you feel like watching some more videos, here’s a small

<p>If you equate God = religion, then yes. If you don’t take dogma into consideration then anything goes, evolution, big-bang, germs, homosexuals and so on and so on.<br />
The problem occurs when you include the dogma in your model - then there is no honest, logical and coherent way to reconcile the two.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It shows misunderstanding of what religion is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apparently depends on what you DEFINE it to be.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Religion is not about proof, it’s about feith.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>fAith. That’s for starters. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you need proof of existence of God, than you are doing it wrong.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed - you cannot have a scientific proof that god exists. Well - you could if god wanted to but hey - he prefers to play hide’n’seek.<br />
BUT - if you claim (what religion does) that GOD has ANY influence on this reality, that he meddles in this world, sends angels, impregnates virgins or splits sea in half - THOSE ARE and will ALWAYS be subjects of scientific inquiries. And as such - you may not verify the god himself, but obviously various claims about him. (Which would be a quite good point for believers - ‘Hey! This amputee’s leg grew back! How’d you explain that, you infidel?!’.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And if you try to<br />
  disprove God with science, than you clearly do not understand the<br />
  concept of feith.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before that - you (not YOU you, the you from the sentence above)
  don’t understand the ‘disprove’ something case.<br />
If you talk in absolute terms, then you can’t disprove ANYTHING. You can’t disprove you’re not a hamster, you can’t disprove this world was created by a huge pipe-smoking rabbit, you can’t disprove science with science.  But precisely due to that absolute terms are useless.</p>

<p>If you talk in practical terms - you actually CAN disprove god just as you can disprove unicorns, fairies, leprechauns or FSM. And practical terms are what actually matters.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many Christians disagree with the teaching of creationism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And many don’t. What’s your point? This is one of the division lines that are drawn from both sides to define the <a href="http://n3m0.jogger.pl/2012/08/28/prawdziwy-chrzescijanin/" rel="nofollow">True Christian</a> INSIDE the Christianity. Various statistics claim that in USA alone 40% of population believes in literal interpretation of the Bible. And they fight evolution with all their might and money (just take a look at Dover Trial - very famous case of religious nutsacks trying to get their foot in the door of public education). In Poland some statics show we have <a href="http://sigvatr.jogger.pl/2012/08/22/kreacjonizm-w-polsce-ma-sie-lepiej-niz-myslalem/" rel="nofollow">37% of people who accept the evolution</a>. Considering we have 95% of Catholics (at least officially, in reality is closer to 35-40%) then it does not make a good case for your point. Other religious countries are in this regard similar.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And so that was my part in fighting misconceptions.  If you came to<br />
  this site already accepting evolution than at least I hope you have<br />
  learned something new.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, thanks! Nylon eating bacteria is news for me so yeah.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, it does not contradict the existence of god, it DOES contradict various christian dogmas (original sin included).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Science contradicts literal reading of the Bible (or Qur’an, or whatever other holy text) and creationism is exactly that.</p>

<p>The point I’m trying to make, and I hope creationists will realise, is that religion is not about literal reading of the Bible.</p>

<p>And because theologists with at least half a brain are aware of that, the dogmas are not taken word for word from the Bible but rather interpreted as a symbol.  Catholic Church does not claim that taking the apple was the sin, but rather that there was some sin, and in Bible it is represented by an apple.</p>

<p>So if you want me to define religion I would say that, in the context of this discussion, religion is interpretation of the whatever holy texts given religion has.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>fAith. That’s for starters.</p>

<p>Ah, thanks, I was writing this at night and aspell failed me for some reason…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Agreed - you cannot have a scientific proof that god exists. Well - you could if god wanted to but hey - he prefers to play hide’n’seek.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I must disagree.  Let’s say that God shows up, starts performing miracles, and so on.  In my opinion, from scientific point of view, He will be just some man who mastered forces of nature better than we did.  But that’s a rather academic discussion.</p>

<blockquote>

How'd you explain that, you infidel?!’.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed, but one time event which cannot be reproduced, do not have that much of a scientific value.  If you observed amputee’s leg grow back you may try and form theories but you won’t be able to repeat experiment and thus validate the theory.</p>

<p>For science, such event will remain an unsolved problem.  For religion, it might be proof of God.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you talk in practical terms - you actually CAN disprove god just as you can disprove unicorns, fairies, leprechauns or FSM. And practical terms are what actually matters.</p>

<p>All right, I see what you are getting at, so let me put what I’m trying to convey more explicitly:</p>

<p>In my entry, I am <em>not</em> trying to convert people to atheism, and I am <em>not</em> trying to disprove existence of God.  In fact, I do believe that religion and science are separate fields and one cannot (or should not) be used to reason about the other.</p>

<p>Moreover, another message I’d like to convey is that if you believe in God <em>and</em> you feel that your religion demands that you interpret the holy text of your religion literally, please note that many theologists of various religions consider that not to be true.  Instead, they consider religion and science to be fully compatible and thus you can be true to your religion <em>and</em> accept all that science has to offer.</p>

<p>a) science determines what is literal and what is a myth in religion. Genesis was treated literal until science came and disproven it. So was with every other biblical testimony that was later disproven by science. So to say that science and religion don’t mix is a bit of a ‘no no’. When science tells you what of your holy scripture starts being a metaphor instead of literal word of God then you have a problem</p>

<p>b) cafeteria-believers are a common thing. But see - you just can’t go and pick and choose. When you do that with the scripture you can prove anything. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Catholic Church does not claim that taking the apple was the sin, but rather that there was some sin, and in Bible it is represented by an apple.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When do you draw the line? On what basis? Who told you to draw it here and not there? So was Adam and Eve a metaphore? What about Cain and Abel, Noah, Lot, Jefte, Abraham, Moses, Jesus? Which one of them was a metaphore and which was not (each and every one of them has a similar scientific proof of existence - none). Bible Tower, Flood, 7 Plagues, whole Leviticus, She-bears, Incest, Rape, Murder, Gore, Animal Genitals? Which one of those are metaphor and which are literal? Is half of the entire book a symbol? Why? Who told you so?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So if you want me to define religion I would say that, in the context of this discussion, religion is interpretation of the whatever holy texts given religion has.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well yes - in such situation you can reconcile both religion and science. But you know what - using this basis you can do exactly the same with Harry Potter, Spiderman and Bolek and Lolek.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I love how you personify a being that is supposedly outside of realm of time and space, and universe and is everything and whatnot. Anyway - I am sure God would know exactly what he would have to do to convince each and every person on the planet.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Scientific value of one-time occurence? Like Big-Bang?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is what matters for science, yes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is what matters for all of us. Practical terms. Otherwise religious people would have to believe in leprechauns because in absolute terms they can’t disprove them. And fairies. And unicorns…</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Well then you must admit it is quite funny that you claim Genesis to be true AND literal for 1800 years, then Science comes in, says it is not and suddenly church claims Genesis to be true and MYTHICAL. If you can’t use one to reason about the other, what makes the unmistakable pope to change his mind? What makes religion to change dogma? Religion? Or maybe - science?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, I know. One thing is those caffeteria-believers. The other is - believers themselves (in our case Christians) draw the line that divides them inside their own faith. And when you start twisting your religion to fit the science  with ‘oh it doesn’t mean that’ you can do literally anything.</p>

<p>The one thing that honest and coherent person would not be able to do is to reconcile different religions with each other. Even though abrahamic religions are quite similar, they cannot be reconciled even if you use shitloads of metaphors. Either Jesus was a god or just a prohpet. Either he was real prophet or false one. Either you have one god or shitloads of them with elepahnt heads (hindu). Either you go to heaven or you reincarnate. And so on and so on. You could actually reconcile the two, but the amount of twisting would make you able to reconcile Mhatma Ghandi with Chyngis Kchan.</p>

<p>To sum up - Religions can’t all be right. But they all can be wrong.</p>

<p>Sorry for the delay, was busy at work (also, Jogger bot doesn’t seem to work for some reason).</p>

<p>Nonetheless, n3m0, I must disappoint you, as I’m not really interested in proving or disproving religion or God, and therefore to participate in this particular discussion.</p>

<p>I’m an atheist, but I’ve always found somewhat weird the anti-evolution arguments from creationists along the lines of "XYZ is too unlikely, it’s impossible to occur naturally, must have been hand-crafted by God". Ironically that goes <em>against</em> the notion of omnipotence-"ominintelligence"-omniscience of the God/designer. When I was a theist/deist I just thought that God would just have created a universe that spontaneously develops in the way it apparently did, according to what is observed by science. Even if our ultimate origin is not a "likely" event, it could still be certain, if omniscience is on the table. If one believes in an omnipotent creator God, one can’t say something natural is absolutely "impossible". The actual theory can still be questioned as unlikely, but you’d not do the argument that is equivalent to saying that you’ve found the upper limit of God’s designing/creating capabilities. </p>

<p>"No, I can tell you, not even God would be able to devise a set of fundamental laws from which planets would form, and in some of them, or one of them, humans would evolve. I won’t even deal with something as complex as the brain, you can just stop with the vertebrate’s eye. Absolutely beyond God’s capabilities to anticipate, for sure, that it would evolve. He’d have to hand-craft it manually, that’s the only way he would manage to do it. It’s like Paley’s analogy with the watchmaker. Organisms are complex, like watches, that don’t assemble themselves spontaneously. Therefore a designer is required. But you can’t use the same logic and propose a designed watchmaking system. The watches have to be hand-crafted, not produced themselves by an automatic invention. Even God’s creativity has its limits, just like he can’t create a stone so heavy that he can’t lift."</p>
