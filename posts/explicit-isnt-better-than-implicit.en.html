<p>Continuing <a href="/2021/embrace-the-bloat/">the new tradition of clickbaity
    titles</a>, let’s talk about explicitness.  It’s a subject that comes up
    when bike-shedding language and API designs.  Pointing out that a construct
    or a function exhibits implicit behaviour is often taunted as an ultimate
    winning argument against it.

<p>There are two problems with such line of reasoning.  First of all, people
  claim to care about feature being explicit but came to accept a lot of
  implicit behaviour without batting an eye.  Second of all, no one actually
  agrees what the terms mean.

<p>In this article I’ll demonstrate those two issues and show that ‘explicit
  over implicit’ is the wrong value to uphold.  It’s merely a proxy for a much
  more useful goal interfaces should strive for.  By the end I’ll demonstrate
  what we should look at instead.

<h2>Dispelling the myths</h2>

<p>Let’s start by examining just how explicit Python and Rust are.  After all,
  their communities often boast the virtue of explicitness in their respective
  languages.  I’m sure it’s going to be completely uncontroversial to suggest
  that they may be much more implicit than some give them credit for.


<h3>The Zen of Python is a lie</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">The Zen of Python</a> is
    a collection of aphorisms which represent Python’s guiding principles.  It’s
    not clear, at least to me, whether they are listed in order of importance,
    but the second entry states that ‘explicit is better than implicit’.
    Despite that, there are multiple instances where this rule is broken.  In
    particular, Python implicitly:

<ul>
  <li>creates new variables.  One cannot even argue that the assignment
    statement defines a variable since that’s not the case as can be seen in the
    following toy example:
    <pre>
foo = 'foo'
def func():
        return foo
        foo = 'bar'
print(func())
    </pre>
  <li>propagates exceptions turning any statement into a possible function exit
    point;
  <li>converts values to booleans in conditions.  For example, <code>if
    some_list:</code> is a Pythonic way to check if a list is non-empty
    while <code>if not var:</code> is a Pythonic way of checking whether
    a variable is <code>None</code>;
  <li>converts between booleans, integers and floats in arithmetic operations.
    Depending on the operation, this happens even if both operands are of the
    same type;
  <li>concatenates strings separated by white-space;
  <li>constructs tuples from comma-separated values (without the need to type
    parenthesise);
  <li>loads package’s <code>__init__.py</code> file when importing a module; and
  <li>implicitly returns <code>None</code> from functions lacking explicit
    return.
</ul>

<p>It could even be argued that garbage collection is an implicit behaviour.
  After all, objects are never explicitly freed and all memory management is
  hidden from the user.


<h3>Rust philosophy of explicitness is not a thing</h3>

<p>But let’s not dwell on scripting languages, change gears and go a level lower
  to a compiled and strictly-typed Rust.  While it doesn’t have a formal list of
  guiding principles, explicitness is often cited as an important value.  Yet,
  what’s often forgotten is that Rust implicitly:

<ul>
  <li>infers types,
  <li>infers lifetime in function prototypes,
  <li>shortens lifetimes of references,
  <li>performs <code>Deref</code> coercion,
  <li>passes <code>self</code> by value or reference based on method prototype,
  <li>clones <code>Copy</code> types when passed to functions by value,
  <li>calls <code>drop</code> of <code>Drop</code> objects when they go out of
    scope,
  <li>converts error type when question mark operator is used,
  <li>implicitly returns <code>()</code> from functions lacking tail or
    return expression and
  <li>resolves `format!` named arguments not explicitly listed in invocation of
    the macro.
</ul>

<p>To be even more contrarian, I could claim <code>sort</code>
  method <em>implicitly</em> uses natural ordering.  Or that order of operations
  in <code>230 - 220 / 2</code> expression isn’t explicitly specified.

<p>But the point here isn’t to demonstrate that Python or Rust aren’t
  ‘explicit’.  Rather, it is to show that even languages which seemingly
  champion explicitness compromise on that principle.  This means that saying
  some new feature exhibits implicit behaviour is not a be-all and end-all
  argument for blocking such design.


<h2>‘You’ve typed it so it’s explicit’</h2>

<p>Than again, maybe I’m completely off the mark?  Perhaps all the
  aforementioned behaviour aren’t implicit after all?  For example, Python
  documents <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#booleans">quite
  clearly</a> what values are interpreted as false and which as true.  This
  means that there is nothing implicit in <code>if some_list:</code> not
  executing the body if the list is empty, right?

<p>Some of the examples I’ve enumerated are definitely less clear-cut than
  others, but I challenge anyone who thinks that none of them are valid to come
  up with justification and then present an example of a feature of any
  non-esoteric language which is implicit.  One will quickly realise that either
  at least some of the aforementioned behaviours are implicit or there’s no such
  thing as an implicit behaviour and thus the whole discussion is moot.

<p>Ultimately this leaves us with no commonly agreed definition of what it means
  for a feature or interface to be explicit.  There’s not even a consensus on
  some vague understanding of the phrase.  On one extreme, a not unreasonable
  argument that nothing is implicit could be made (after all a program behaves
  exactly according to language’s documentation), on the other, some C♯
  programmers argue that <code>""</code> isn’t an explicit-enough way of
  specifying an empty string.  Unfortunately, I don’t have a definition which
  would satisfy everyone and thus solve this particular problem.  Instead, I’m
  side-stepping the entire discussion.


<h2>Explicit doesn’t matter</h2>

<p>Because, you see, when people say ‘design X is bad because it’s not explicit’
  they actually don’t care about the feature being implicit.  Instead, they
  (potentially subconsciously) use the level of explicitness as a proxy to
  decide how easy it is to reason about the program.

<p>To continue with Python’s boolean coercion example, it is well understood
  that Python considers zero values and empty containers to be false.  Therefore
  there’s little issue with <code>if some_list:</code> checking whether the list
  is empty.  However, time of day is neither a collection nor a number
  so <code>if
  some_time:</code> <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/590299/">checking whether
  object represents
  midnight</a> <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/ee6bdc07d65d5df418ad9dc2bb7139666af9a6b2">was</a>
  an issue.  It wasn’t because the check was implicit (this was also true when
  testing for empty container) but rather because it was an unexpected
  behaviour.

<p id=b1>When Rust infers types, the compiler picks the only one sensible and
  obvious choice.  If there’s any ambiguity, programmer has to explicitly
  specify the type.  Contrast it with function overloading in C++.  The rules
  are defined, but they are so convoluted only a handful of people understand
  them.  Again, the issue isn’t whether the feature is implicit or not; the
  problem is how easy it is to reason about the code and how likely it is that
  the compiler does something unexpected.<a href="#f1">†</a>


<h3>Principle of least astonishment</h3>

<p>What actually matters is following the principle of least astonishment.
  Rather than wondering whether a particular design is explicit enough, the
  correct question is to ask how likely it is for a feature to lead to
  a surprising behaviour.

<p>Bugs often emerge when the compiler does something programmer doesn’t expect.
  Python treating <code>True</code> as one in arithmetic operations is the only
  sensible non-throwing interpretation which means that the principle is
  preserved.  On the other hand C promoting integers can easily lead to
  astonishing results (such as unsigned object being less than negative value of
  a signed type) which violates the principle.


<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>In conclusion, advocating explicitness for explicitness’s sake is not sound.
  Being explicit is a tool which, in some cases, helps minimise surprises in the
  code and makes it easier to reason about a program.  If implicit behaviour
  does not make the source more confusing that it normally would be, there’s no
  reason to fight it.

<p>But even then, all those things need to be weighted in context of other
  useful properties of a design.  Ergonomics of a programming language matter
  and it may sometimes be worth sacrificing the principle of least astonishment
  if that means the code may be more beautiful (which coincidentally is another
  aphorism from The Zen of Python).


<p id=f1><a href="#b1">†</a> As an aside, confusing a general idea of a feature
  with implementation of the feature in a specific language is another common
  fallacy.  Function resolution in C++ may be convoluted but that doesn’t mean
  that function overloading in general needs to be confusing.  For example,
  picking methods in Java is quite straightforward and allowing overloading on
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arity">arity</a> in Rust would leave no
  ambiguity in the code.  Arguing against default parameters on the account of
  how mystifying C++ can get is therefore invalid.  Similar comparison could be
  made with Python’s treatment of false values.  Yes, it may sometimes lead to
  astonishing results (e.g. intending to test for <code>None</code> but
  forgetting that non-<code>None</code> values are tested as well), but if
  adapted to Rust, those surprising behaviours would not be an issue (thanks to
  strict typing).
