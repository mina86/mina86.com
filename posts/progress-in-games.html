  <p>“…and this pun with savegames in GTA.” my friend laughed.
  <p>“What pun? What savegames?” I asked with a blank stare.
  <p>“You know, ‘Jesus saves’.” he explained looking at me like I’m crazy.
  <p>“Wait, you could save game in GTA?” I raised my brow in disbelief.
</blockquote>
<p>That’s how I found out about savegames in GTA.  This was years after
  I finished the game, twice, completing each city in one go.  But as fun as
  GTA was, it wasn’t the game I spent most time playing.  That title goes to
  Doom 2.  To this day, I put it at the top of all FPS games ever.
<p>Why do I mention those old, long forgotten titles? Let’s fast forward
  a little.

<h2>Apocalypse</h2>

<p>I don’t usually buy games on a tangible medium.  Doom 3, however, is one of
  the few that sits on my shelve.  When I played it though, I had this uneasy
  feeling… Something wasn’t right.  Almost as if I didn’t get what I had hoped
  for.  The game was dark, and slow.  Encounters with monsters jumping out
  from the darkness, were separated by journeys through dark corridors.  Dim
  lights showed you the way in the darkness as you slowly progressed in each
  level, but did not reveal the danger, as that was hidden in dark corners.
<p>I’m not a great writer, so that’s probably why I overused “dark” in the
  above paragraph.  To my defence, so did id Software.  In some respects,
  Doom 3 felt like a technical demo of their shiny rendering engine.  The team
  went overboard with all the new features, and instead of creating
  a successor of a game I love so much, they’ve created a poor attempt at
  duplicating <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/system_shock_2">System
  Shock 2</a> (a game which even with its “outdated” graphics is much
  more enjoyable and immersive then Doom 3)… or something… I don’t know what
  exactly to be honest.
<p>Fortunately, there’s
  also <a href="http://moddb.com/mods/classic-doom-3">Classic Doom 3</a>.
  A mod created by Flaming Sheep Software.  It is a remake of shareware levels
  of the original Doom, and it is <em>wonderful</em>.  It’s fast paced, with
  energetic music, no unneeded interruptions, no cut-scenes, and as
  far as I’m concerned, that’s the game I wanted id Software to make.  It’s
  a pity they didn’t.

<!-- EXCERPT -->

<h2>Anger</h2>

<p>Still, I cannot say it was a bad game, and I did not, at that time, loose
  confidence in id Software’s ability to create a great shooter.  That’s why,
  when I craved some good FPS, I got my hands on Rage, id’s latest product.
<p>I’m starting the game.  Standing by the exit of the Ark I check my grip
  on a mouse — I’m ready for my first encounter.  Crouching, I enter the
  wilderness, watching my each step, I’m prepared to face the—
<p>“Wait, what just happened?” I look at the screen baffled. “Oh, it’s just
  a cut-scene, an extended intro I guess…” I take a sip of my tea while the
  protagonist sits in a car-thingy to escape danger with a newly found friend.
  A friend, who later leads to a realisation dialogues are not
  skippable — NPCs just keep talking, and one has to wait till they’re
  finished to get a quest.  Walking away looks like a valid work-around
  though.
<p>More playing revealed that Rage is some kind of hybrid between Borderlands
  and Death Race, both of which are worth recommending, but when id made
  them, they felt like another technical demo.  As if they wanted to show how
  one can do both a shooter and a racing game using their engine.  Pity they
  themselves couldn’t.  Riding the vehicles only inflated gameplay time
  without adding anything to the plot or actual shooter experience.  The
  “technical demo” impression was reinforced by the fact that Rage took two
  short evenings to finish.

<h2>487A</h2>

<p>In the end I did finish Rage (even with all the boring time sinks) and this
  is more than I can say about GTA 4.  Recalling all the fun I had playing
  GTA, I decided to take a look at it’s latest version.

<p>Admittedly, the intro was nicely done, and I really enjoyed it.  It was not
  as good as Witcher’s, but still, a calm pace and “cast” information nicely
  intermingled into the video, set a mood for a hopefully interesting game.
  Then, the developers decided to treat me like an idiot.  I got used to games
  assuming I have no idea how to move, so with a slight sigh I got through
  this part.  I still had hope.

<p>Unfortunately, the more I played, the more I disliked GTA 4.  Instead of
  having mission after mission, where I steal cars, run away from police, and
  run over innocent pedestrians, I was greeted with a ton of boring
  cut-scenes, a bowling simulator, a dating simulator, and other random
  content (none of which was particularly good).  The things I loved GTA for
  so much were, however, hard to find.

<h2>Call of Doom</h2>

<p>Are we really entering an age where games are all about slick graphics,
  heavily scripted locations and long cut-scenes?  Playing various triple
  A titles I certainly feel that way and that it progresses
  rapidly — for instance with Mass Effect that amount of
  cut-scenes increased and complexity of dialogues seemed to decrease with each sequel,
  and even though the last one reportedly had more dialogue lines than any
  previous, it was likely because the dialogues were longer, not because
  player had more choices.

<p>But my opinion is, of course, not the only one.  Some say scripted
  FPS games make for a more immersive experience.  That such games can
  be viewed as “interactive books”.  I gave this idea a try, and
  played through single player campaign of Battlefield 3.

<p>Immersed was definitely not what I felt.  More like annoyed.

<p>For starters, each scripted encounter had its own one-time mechanics.  On
  top of which developers could not even write a proper key binding
  configuration system.  The end result was that I had to reply some of the
  scenes multiple times

<p>Furthermore, characters in books can travel great distances in an instant.
  On one page they are here, on the next one, they are across the city.  No
  problem.  But in B3 it felt like the second most time consuming part of the
  game (after replying scripted encounters) was running mindlessly following
  some other character – if I really wanted to
  play <a href="http://desertbus-game.org/" rel="nofollow">Desert Bus</a>,
  I would have done so…

<h2>Hope must lay with the proles</h2>

<p>I sometimes feel we’d be better off without all the fancy graphics cards
  able to render nearly movie-like quality scenes.  In a world where
  developers have to think of ways to interest player other than just adding
  more non-interactive content.  This is of course exaggeration, and I’ll be
  the first to admit that games like VVVVVV should have never been created,
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ap87xnjOh8E" rel="nofollow">Notch
  manifested how lazy and/or incompetent he is by using graphics from
  1980s</a>, and that Another World 20th Anniversary Edition is even more
  enjoyable then it’s original, but the point is that the game was fun to play
  even without those graphics.

<p>There seems to be something about having limited resources to develop
  a “next generation” graphical engine, that forces game developers to think
  of different ways to engage the player.

<p>I’ve also had a pleasure of trying out Civilisation V and I’m saying
  “pleasure” despite me not being a huge fan of the franchise (probably
  because sadly I’m not that good at strategies).  Even though the graphics
  and various screens were updated and some introduced a 3D animated figures,
  there were no intrusive, overly-long cut-scenes.  No time sinks adding
  nothing to the gameplay.  There was no overuse of the engine.  The studio
  kept to the roots.  They kept what made the game great only updating it
  wherever it made sense.

<p>In the past I would make fun of games like FIFA or Need for Speed
  (admittedly I’ve never played the former and only a little of the latter)
  where it would seem that each new version is just updated graphics and new
  players/cars to choose from.  But maybe FPS and RPG developers should look
  closely at such franchises and try not introducing more stuff whose only
  purpose is to look good?  Like the meme goes, “try not adding another
  cut-scene on your way to the car.”
