<p>A quick reminder that relative URLs can start with a double slash and
  that this means something different than a single slash at the beginning.
  Specifically, such relative addresses are resolved by taking the schema (and
  only the schema) of the website they are on.

<p>For example, the code for the link to my repositories in the site’s header
  is <code>&lt;a href="//github.com/mina86"&gt;Code&lt;/a&gt;</code>.  Since
  this page uses <code>https</code> schema, browsers will navigate
  to <code>https://github.com/mina86</code> if the link is activated.

<p>This little trick can save you some typing, but more importantly, if you’re
  developing a URL parsing code or a crawler, make sure that it handles this
  case correctly.  It may seem like a small detail, but it can have a lasting
  impact on the functionality of your code.
