<p>Just a quick message to remained/inform everyone that relative URLs can start
  with a double slash and that it means something different than a single slash
  at the beginning.  Specifically, such relative addresses are resolved by
  taking schema of the website they are on (and keeping everything else as is).

<p>For example, code for the link to my repositories in the site’s header
  is <code>&lt;a href="//github.com/mina86"&gt;Code&lt;/a&gt;</code>.  Since
  this page uses <code>https</code> schema, browsers will navigate
  to <code>https://github.com/mina86</code> if the link is activated.

<p>This may save you some typing but more importantly, if you’re developing
  a URL parsing code or a crawler make sure that it handles this case correctly.
