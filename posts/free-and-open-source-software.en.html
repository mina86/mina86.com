<p>Some people struggle to understand the distinctions between ‘free software’
  and ‘open source software.’ Let’s clear up the confusion with an analogy.

<p>Imagine a world without vegetarianism.  One day, someone proposes a new diet
  called ‘moral eating,’ which excludes meat for ethical reasons.  Some people
  embrace it, and discover additional benefits like reduced environmental
  impact.  However, advocates observe that implying people not adhering to the
  diet are immoral isn’t the best recruitment strategy.  They coin the term
  ‘sustainable eating’ to focus on the environmental advantages.

<p>But now people get bogged down in philosophical debates.  If one uses the
  term ‘moral eating’ some assume they don’t care about the environment; on the
  other hand, if one says ‘sustainable eating’ some assume they don’t care about
  animals.  To avoid this an all-encompassing acronym MSE (Moral and Sustainable
  Eating) is created.  It signifies the same thing — no meat — but avoids
  getting entangled in justifications.

<p>And so we end up with three distinct terms — moral eating, sustainable eating
  and MSE — which all refer to the same diat.  What we call vegetarianism.

<p>This is how the terms free software, open source and FOSS (Free and Open
  Source Software) came to be.  They all represent the same category of software
  with a different advocacy philosophy.  Free software
  emphasises <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html.en#four-freedoms">the
  four essential freedoms</a> and open source
  uses <a href="https://opensource.org/osd">the Open Source Definition</a>.
  While the latter might be more explicit on some points — it overtly prohibits
  discrimination against any people or field of endeavour — the four freedoms
  implicitly cover them as well.


<h2>Source-available software</h2>

<p>Here’s where things get tricky.  Some companies try to capitalize on the
  positive associations of open source without truly adhering to its principles.
  They might ‘open their software’ but release source code under a license that
  restricts creating derivative works.  This could be due to genuine
  misunderstanding or intentional manipulation.  Whatever the reason, if the
  four essential freedoms aren’t granted, the code isn’t open source.  This type
  of software is more accurately
  called <dfn><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-available_software">source-available
  software</a></dfn>.


<h2>Libre Software</h2>

<p>Another point of confusion is the ambiguity of the term ‘free software.’
  ‘Free’ can refer to price or freedom.  The common saying ‘free as in freedom,
  not as in beer’ attempts to clarify this imprecision.  To eliminate the
  ambiguity altogether, the terms <dfn>libre software</dfn>
  or <dfn>libreware</dfn> have emerged.  And to include it in the FOSS acronym
  it’s sometimes replaced with FLOSS (Free, Libre and Open Source Software).

<p>Proprietary software that one can acquire without paying is
  called <dfn>freeware</dfn>.  It’s distinct from free software, which is only
  concerned with user freedoms and permits selling of the software.


<h2>Creative Commons and Free Software</h2>

<p>Lastly, it’s worth mentioning
 the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> organisation.
 It aims to simplify copyright by allowing creators to share their work with
 specific permissions.  While its goals align somewhat with free software, it’s
 important to note that not all Creative Commons licenses qualify.  Any license
 that disallows derivative works (NoDerivatives) or commercial use
 (NonCommercial) doesn’t meet the criteria for free software.

<p>There are three Creative Commons licenses which are considered free software:
<ul>
  <li>CC0, which is roughly equivalent to something being in Public Domain,
  <li>CC BY (Attribution), which is roughly equivalent to permissive free
    software licenses and
  <li>CC BY-SA (Attribution-ShareAlike), which is roughly equivalent to copyleft
    free software licenses.
</ul>

<p>However, when licensing source code, it’s generally recommended to use
  licenses specifically designed for software, such as various GPL variants, the
  Mozilla Public License, the Apache license, or the MIT license.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Free software, open source software, libre software, libreware, FOSS and
  FLOSS all describe the same category of software: software with source code
  that users can freely run, modify, and redistribute.  Source-available
  software has accessible code whose license prevents one of those activities.
