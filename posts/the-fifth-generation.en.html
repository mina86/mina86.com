<p>This day must have come sooner or later.  Even more so since I love
  squeezing every byte out of the data being sent over the network,
  which is why source of this website is so unreadable (don’t worry
  though, readable sources are
  available <a href="https://github.com/mina86/mina86.com">in a git
  repository</a>).

<p>So yeah.  I’ve switched this website to HTML5 with some of it’s new
  elements and optional tags removed.  After years of using XHTML 1.1
  it feels a bit weird not closing tags, but I guess a few saved bytes
  are worth it, aren’t they? ;)

<p>I’ve even got my electric slash working in Emacs’s html-mode
  (ie. if I press slash after &lt; sign, inner most element is closed
  automatically).

<p>Unfortunately, not all is so shiny.  For some reason, automatic
  pagination on entries list page and ‘load content’ link stopped
  working under Opera.  The way those work is by making an
  XMLHttpRequest and injecting portion of the fetched document in
  appropriate place.  For some reason, Opera ends up with
  a <code>DOMException: INVALID_STATE_ERR</code>.

<p>Ohh, ekhem… fock the pagination — add ‘like’ buttons, you know…<br />
Anyway, I’d say this is the most beautiful website made in HTML5 that I have ever seen in my whole life.

<p>Good Job!

<p>‘Like’ is unlikely (no pun intended) but ‘+1’ maybe. ;) And thanks!
<p>Update: And so I’ve added +1. And Twitter.

<p>But I really don’t understand why some cool websites (eg. <a href="http://www.prezi.com/">Prezi</a>) don’t want to use HTML5 instead of Adobe Flash.<p>Adobe Flash (now) is an old technology and most devices (eg. Android dev., iOS dev.) doesn’t support this solution.

<p>AFAIK Android supports Flash, but the comment is valid nonetheless.
