<p>This website being my personal project allows me to experiment and do things
  I’d never do in professional settings.  Most notably, I’m rather found of
  trying everything I can to reduce the size of the page.  This goes beyond mere
  minification and eventually lead me to wonder if all those characters I’ve
  been escaping in HTML code really need such treatment.

<p>Libraries offering HTML support will typically provide a function to
  indiscriminately replace all ampersands, quote characters, less-than and
  greater-then signs with their corresponding HTML-safe representation.  This
  allows the result to be used in any context in the document and is a good
  choice for user-input validation.  It’s a different matter when it comes to
  squeezing every last byte.  Herein I will explore just which characters and
  when exactly really need to be escaped in an HTML document.

<!-- EXCERPT -->


<h2>Greater- and less-than signs</h2>

<p>U+003E <span class=ud>greater-than sign</span> is a deeply misunderstood
  character.  All it really wants is to be left alone to live in peace.  Sadly,
  all those pesky web developers keep escaping it and replacing
  with <code>&amp;gt;</code> even though in vast majority of cases it’s not
  necessary.  U+003C <span class=ud>less-than sign</span>, greater-than sign’s
  little brother, has a slightly easier life.  While people indiscriminately
  escape it as well, this time it’s somewhat justifiable.

<p>Greater-than sign has no special meaning in HTML data.  It’s therefore valid
  and correct to write HTML code such as <code>&lt;p&gt;Linux > Windows >
  macOS</code>.  Less-than sign on the other has a special meaning — it’s what
  starts a tag after all — and as such must be escaped when outside of a tag.
  In other words HTML agrees, <code>&lt;p&gt;Windows &lt; macOS</code> is not
  a valid statement.

<p>What’s also not alright is using either of those characters in an unquoted
  attribute value.  For example <code>&lt;em title=Rust>Go>this
  code&lt;/em></code> would be rendered as a single EM element with ‘Rust’ title
  and ‘Go>this code’ text.  If that’s not the intention, the value has to be
  escaped.  This is hardly a legitimate use-case though.  Rather than escaping
  the characters it’s better to quote the value.  The code ends up shorter and
  easier to read as evident by <code>&lt;em title="PW>UW">this
  code&lt;/em></code>.


<h2>Ampersand</h2>

<p>U+0026 <span class=ud>ampersand</span>, is a whole other story.  She leads
  a tumultuous life full of change and adventure where in the end no one really
  knows what she wants.  Life was simple in the olden days.  Ampersand had to be
  escaped in every context.  But HTML5 has complicated things quite a bit.

<p>First of all, an ampersand which is not followed by an alphanumeric character
  or a hash does not need to be escape.  <code>Steinway & Sons</code> is
  therefore perfectly fine just like <code>curlun &&
  !fsg_lun_is_open(curlun)</code>.

<p>It would make sense to conclude that escaping is required if an
  ampersand <em>is</em> followed by one of those characters, which is probably
  why this is not the case.  <code>&lt;p&gt;Copy&amp;paste</code> for example is
  a perfectly valid code because there’s no character reference named ‘paste’
  (or any which would be a prefix of that string).  When processing named
  character references the standard requires that the longest possible match is
  made but if none can be found the characters are treated verbatim.
  Furthermore, the semicolon ending the reference is part of that matching and
  some <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/named-characters.html">references
  are defined</a> with and some without the semicolon.

<p>As a consequence, <code>&lt;p>&amp;pi &amp;notin &amp;Qopf</code> ends up
  rendered as ‘&amp;pi ¬in &amp;Qopf’.  To understand why this is the case one
  needs to realise that there <em>is</em> a named character reference
  named <code>not</code> (without a semicolon) while there <em>isn’t</em> one
  called <code>notin</code>.  When the browser
  encounters <code>&amp;notin</code> the longest string it can match
  is <code>not</code> and thus it interprets <code>&amp;not</code> as
  a U+00AC <span class=ud>not sign</span> leaving <code>in</code> intact.
  Correct way to write the statement is <code>&lt;p>&amp;pi; &amp;notin;
  &amp;Qopf;</code> which yields ‘π ∉ ℚ’ as expected.  Adding semicolons fixes
  the code because <code>pi;</code>, <code>notin;</code> and <code>Qopf;</code>
  (with semicolons) character references are all defined.

<p>That could lead to a conclusion that ampersand does not need escaping unless
  it’s followed by a hash or a defined named character reference.  That’s not
  quite the case though since there’s also such a thing
  as <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#syntax-ambiguous-ampersand">an
  ambiguous ampersand</a>:

<blockquote>
  <p>An <dfn>ambiguous
      ampersand</dfn> is an U+0026 <span class=ud>AMPERSAND</span> character
      (&) that is followed by one or more ASCII alphanumerics, followed by
      a U+003B <span class=ud>semicolon</span> character (;), where these
      characters do not match any of the names given in the named character
      references section.
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, while <code>copy&paste</code> is valid because there’s no
  named character reference
  called <code>paste</code>, <code>copy&amp;paste;</code> isn’t because there’s
  no named character reference called <code>paste;</code>… Confused yet?
  There’s more.

<p>Another exception introduced in HTML5 is treatment of ampersand in
  attributes.  While in data state — when reading code outside of
  tags — semicolon is not always required, when parsing attribute values a named
  character reference must be terminated by a semicolon or else it will be taken
  verbatim.  For example, <code>&lt;a
  href="/?book=Ecc&amp;sect=1&amp;para=2">/?book=Ecc&amp;sect=1&amp;para=2&lt;/a></code>
  defines a link whose hypertext reference is ‘/?book=Ecc&amp;sect=1&amp;para=2’
  but whose text is ‘/?book=Ecc§=1¶=2’ (despite the same code being used for
  both strings).

<p>As inconsistent as all of it sounds, this is what browsers were often doing
  anyway even before the behaviour was codified.  They always tried to be
  accommodating to errors in the document and would therefore accept entity
  references with missing semicolon and try to interpret them the way author
  intended rather than strictly adhere to the standard.  HTML5 simply got all
  browsers in line and made it possible to copy URLs into attributes without
  worry.


<h2>Honourable mentions</h2>

<p>For the sake of completeness, last thing to mention are a few more characters
  which need to be escaped in attribute values.  First of all, in an unquoted
  attribute white-space characters (tab, line feed, form feed or space),
  U+0022 <span class=ud>quotation mark</span>,
  U+0027 <span class=ud>apostrophe</span>, U+003D <span class=ud>equals
  sign</span> and U+0060 <span class=ud>grave accent</span> all need to be
  escaped in addition to the three characters discussed earlier.  The usual way
  of dealing with that is of course quoting the value at which point only
  quotation mark (a.k.a. double quote) or apostrophe (a.k.a. single quote) needs
  escaping depending which of the two is used to quote the string.


<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>What exactly are the rules for escaping characters in HTML?  Below is a quick
  recap:

<dl>
  <dt><span class=ud>greater-than sign</span> (&gt;)
  <dd>Must be escaped in unquoted attribute only.

  <dt><span class=ud>less-than sign</span> (&lt;)
  <dd>Must be escaped in data and unquoted attribute.

  <dt><span class=ud>ampersand</span> (&amp;)
  <dd>Simple rule of thumb is that the character must be escaped if it’s
    followed by a hash or an alphanumeric character.  The actual, more complex,
    rule is that it must be escaped if i) it is followed by a hash, ii) it is
    followed by sequence of alphanumeric characters followed by a semicolon or
    iii) if it’s outside of an attribute and is followed
    by <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/named-characters.html">a named
    character reference defined by the standard</a>.  If decision needs to be
    made without access to the list of named character references, one helpful
    observation is that no defined name starts with a digit so unless an
    ambiguous ampersand would be formed an ampersand followed by a digit does
    not need escaping.

  <dt><span class=ud>quotation mark</span> (")
  <dt><span class=ud>apostrophe</span> (')
  <dd>Must be escaped in unquoted attribute and in quoted one if it was the
    character used to quote the value.

  <dt>White-space (tab, line feed, form feed or space)
  <dt><span class=ud>equals sign</span> (=)
  <dt><span class=ud>grave accent</span> (`)
  <dd>Must be escaped in unquoted attribute.
