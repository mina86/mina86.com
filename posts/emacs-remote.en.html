<p>I often develop software on remote machines; logged in via SSH to
  a workstation where all source code reside.  In those situations, I like to
  have things work the same way regardless of which host I’m on.  Since more
  often than not I open files from shell rather than from within my editor, this
  in particular means having the same command opening files in Emacs available
  on all computers.  <code>emacsclient <var>filename</var></code> works locally
  but gets a bit tricky over SSH.

<p>Running Emacs in a terminal is of course possible, but graphical interface
  provides minor benefits which I like to keep.  X forwarding is another option
  but gets sluggish over high-latency connections.  And besides, having multiple
  Emacs instance running (one local and one remote) is <em>not</em> the way.

<p>Fortunately, by utilising SSH remote forwarding, Emacs can be configured to
  edit remote files and accept server commands from within an SSH session.
  Herein I will describe how to accomplish that.

<!-- EXCERPT -->

<h2>Starting Emacs server</h2>

<p>First step is to get edit server running.  <dfn>Edit server</dfn> is
  a feature of Emacs which allows the editor to be controlled by a separate
  process, namely emacsclient.  Its most obvious benefit is opening files in an
  existing Emacs instance rather than having to launch a new copy each time.
  The simplest way to start a server is by calling <code>start-server</code>
  command inside of Emacs by typing <kbd>M-x server-start RET</kbd>.  If the
  server is working correctly, executing <code>emacsclient -e
  emacs-version</code> in a terminal should result in Emacs version being
  printed.

<pre class="fr sm" style="--w:25em">
$ emacsclient -e '
(if server-use-tcp (error "Using TCP")
  (concat server-socket-dir "/" server-name))
'
"/run/user/1000/emacs/server"
</pre>

<p>There
  are <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Emacs-Server.html">other
  ways to start a server</a>.  Whichever method one picks, the important points
  are to i) make sure TCP is not used and ii) note where the UNIX-domain socket
  is created.  The former is the case if <code>server-use-tcp</code>
  is <code>nil</code>; the later is indicated by <code>server-socket-dir</code>
  and <code>server-name</code> variables.  Their values can be inspected by
  typing <kbd>C-h v <var>variable-name</var> RET</kbd> (which
  runs <code>describe-variable</code> command).

<table class="fr sm" style="--w:25em">
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Variable<th>Expected value
  <tbody>
    <tr><td><code>server-use-tcp</code><td><code>nil</code>
    <tr><td><code>server-socket-dir<code>
        <td>"<code>/run/user/<var>&lt;UID&gt;</var>/emacs</code>"
    <tr><td><code>server-name</code><td>"<code>server</code>"
</table>

<p>Note that where exactly the socket ends up may vary.  To keep things simple,
  this article assumes values as listed in the table on the right.  Depending on
  particular system, commands and configuration described further down may need
  adjustments to match where the server’s socket is actually located.


<h2 id=security>Security implications</h2>

<p>Before going further, there’s an important security consideration.  The edit
  server protocol allows for Elisp forms to be sent for evaluation.  This means
  that whoever connects to the editor can execute arbitrary code with privileges
  of the user Emacs runs under.  Normally this is not an issue since only the
  user running the server is able to connect to it.

<p>However, just like with X and agent forwarding, remote socket forwarding
  gives remote host’s administrator access to local socket which can be
  exploited to run arbitrary code on local host.  Solution described herein is
  therefore <em>not</em> recommended unless administrator of the remote host is
  trusted.


<h2>Forwarding the socket</h2>

<p>Rather than talking abstracting about local and remote hosts, it might be
  more fun to pick some names for machines in question.  Naming things is the
  most difficult things in it, but let us settle on the local machine being
  earth.local while the remote one phobos.mars.uac.

<p>To allow emacsclient running on Phobos to communication with Emacs back on
  Earth, socket created by the edit server needs to be forwarded.  Fortunately,
  analogous to TCP, OpenSSH supports UNIX-domain socket forwarding.  To know
  what to forward, two paths need to be determined: i) location of the
  UNIX-domain socket which local Emacs is listening on; and ii) path where remote
  emacsclient will look for a socket.  Both typically lay under user’s XDG
  runtime directory and thus can be determined with a little help from
  xdg-user-dir tool:

<pre>
user@earth$ <b>local_socket=$(xdg-user-dir RUNTIME)/emacs/server</b>
user@earth$ <b>remote_socket=$(ssh -aknxSnone phobos.mars.uac \
                          xdg-user-dir RUNTIME)/emacs/earth</b>
user@earth$ <b>test -S "$local_socket" || echo Missing local socket</b>
user@earth$ <b>printf '‘%s’\n' "$local_socket" "$remote_socket"</b>
‘/run/user/1000/emacs/server’
‘/run/user/1234/emacs/earth
</pre>

<p>It is good idea to use a non-standard server name on remote side to avoid
  clashes if an unrelated Emacs server happened to be running there already.
  The snippet above uses the default ‘<code>server</code>’ on local side while
  ‘<code>earth</code>’ on remote side indicating which computer the socket leads
  to.  With the paths determined, the next step is to enable socket forwarding
  when opening a new SSH session.  Options and syntax for UNIX-domain socket
  forwarding are the same as for TCP port forwarding.  In particular
  the <code>-R</code> switch is used on command line used as follows:

<pre>
user@earth$ <b>ssh -R "$remote_socket:$local_socket" phobos.mars.uac</b>
</pre>

<p>Once authenticated, SSH will create <code>$remote_socket</code> on Phobos and
  forward all incoming connections to <code>$local_socket</code> on Earth.  With
  that, remote emacsclient will be able to talk to local Emacs through that
  socket.  This can be tested by executing the following inside of the SSH
  session:

<pre>
user@phobos$ <b>emacsclient -s earth -e '(system-name)'</b>
"local"
user@phobos$ <b>emacsclient -s earth -T /ssh:phobos.mars.uac: <var>filename</var></b>
</pre>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/">TRAMP</a> (which
  enables transparent access to remote files from within Emacs), Emacs running
  on Earth will open <var>filename</var> located on Phobos.  If instead it tries
  to open a local file, there may be issues with TRAMP configuration.
  Adding <code>(require 'tramp)</code>
  to <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-File.html">Emacs’
  initialisation file</a> should fix that issue.


<h2>Making it permanent</h2>

<p>Explicitly specifying the <code>-R</code> flag each time would be rather
  tedious.  On top of that, things break once SSH session is terminated and new
  one established.  The socket on remote side is never cleaned and as a result
  a new tunnel cannot be created.  Both of those issues can be easily solved
  with some configuration.  To get it sorted, the following section should be
  added to <code>~/.ssh/config</code>:

<pre id="alias">
Host phobos
    HostName phobos.mars.uac
    RemoteForward /run/user/1234/emacs/earth /run/user/100/emacs/server
    StreamLocalBindUnlink yes
    ControlMaster auto
    ControlPersist 30m  # or 1
</pre>

<p><code>Host</code> defines an alias for the host such that full domain name
  does not need to by typed each time.  Instead, <code>HostName</code> specifies
  the full domain.  <code>RemoteForward</code> cakes care of the <code>-R</code>
  switch.  Paths given in the example may, of course, need to be
  adjusted.  <code>StreamLocalBindUnlink yes</code> addresses the issue of stale
  sockets blocking new forwarding attempts.

<p>Lastly, <code>ControlMaster</code> and <code>ControlPersist</code>
  configures <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSSH/Cookbook/Multiplexing">multiplexing</a>
  which makes SSH reuse a single TCP connection rather than creating a new one
  each time a new session is requested.  This avoids superfluous socket
  forwarding tunnels being created if one is already available.
  The <code>30m</code> persist timeout means that control master will keep the
  connection open for half an hour after last SSH session is closed.  If thirty
  minutes is too long for some reason, the timeout can be brought down to one.
  I do not recommend disabling it altogether though, because then the
  first <code>ssh</code> invocation (which establishes the multiplexing
  connection and became control master) will hang for as long as any SSH
  sessions are active.

<p>With all that set up, the configuration can be tested with a much more
  concise set of commands:

<pre>
user@earth$ <b>ssh -R "$remote_socket:$local_socket" phobos.mars.uac</b>
user@phobos$ <b>emacsclient -s earth -T /ssh:phobos: <var>filename</var></b>
</pre>

<p>To make the setup even more convenient, one can create an alias on remote
  host for the emacsclient invocation.  For example by adding the following
  to <code>~/.bashrc</code> (or equivalent shell’s runtime configuration file):

<pre>alias e='emacsclient -s earth -T /ssh:phobos:'</pre>

<p>And that’s it.  If you’re satisfied with TRAMP this is the entire setup and
  there is no need to fiddle with it.  However, I found it to be a bit slow on
  high-latency connections and use SSHFS instead.  I’ve described this
  alternative approach in <a href="/2021/emacs-remote-sshfs/">another
  article</a>.
