<p>Some time ago, I’ve modified the
<code>tabbed</code> <a href="http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/rxvt-unicode.html"
rel="nofollow">rxvt-unicode</a> extension adding a few useful
features.  Somehow upstream did not want it while people started
modifying the extension even more and so <code>tabbedex</code> fork
came to be.  The code can
be <a href="https://github.com/mina86/urxvt-tabbedex">browsed on
GitHub</a> or cloned
from <code>git://github.com/mina86/urxvt-tabbedex.git</code>

<p><code>tabbedex</code> carries a lot of changes and it
  would be futile to try and list them all here especially as the list
  would likely become out of date soon.  Because of that, I recommend
  taking a look at the source code, which has, at the very beginning,
  a comment with a list of changes made.
