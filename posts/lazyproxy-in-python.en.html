<p>Paths of destiny lead mysterious ways.  Not so long ago, I was
  a hard-core C hacker and now, I spend a lot of the time coding in <a
  href=/2010/python-wrazenia/>Python</a>.

  <p>In somehow related news, I have discovered that my
  search-foo is not good enough, when I was unable to find a decent
  implementations of several design patterns in Python.

  <p>What I needed was a generic proxy that would defer initialisation
  of an object to the moment it is first used.  Here is what I came up with:

<pre>
class LazyProxy(object):
    __slots__ = '__get'

    def __init__(self, cls, *args, **kw):
        object.__setattr__(self, '_LazyProxy__get',
                           lambda: self.__set(cls(*args, **kw)))

    def __set(self, obj):
        object.__setattr__(self, '_LazyProxy__get', lambda: obj)
        return obj

    def __getattr__(self, name):
        return getattr(self.__get(), name)

    def __setattr__(self, name, value):
        return setattr(self.__get(), name, value)

    def __delattr__(self, name):
        return delattr(self.__get(), name)</pre>

<p>Here’s how one can use it:

  <pre>
class Foo(object):
    foo = 'foo'

    def __init__(self, bar, baz):
        print 'Creating Foo...'
        self.foo = 'foobar'
        self.bar = bar
        self.baz = baz

    def a(self):
        print 'Foo.a: self=(foo=%s, bar=%s, baz=%s)' % (
            self.foo, self.bar, self.baz)

    @classmethod
    def b(cls):
        print 'Foo.b: cls=%s, cls.foo=%s' % (
            cls.__name__, cls.foo)

    @staticmethod
    def c():
        print 'Foo.c'

foo = LazyProxy(Foo, 'bar', baz='qux')
print 'LazyProxy created'
foo.a()
foo.b()
foo.c()</pre>

  <p><code>foo</code> can be used in (almost) the same
  way as an already created <code>Foo</code> object would.  The only
  caveat is it will not be an instance of <code>Foo</code> which may or
  may not be an issue. Also, it is not thread safe.

<p>I remember that some time ago you also wrote somethink like ‘why I don’t like Gentoo’, so next post will be ‘Coding Python on Gentoo’? ;)

<p>That’s really unlikely. ;) If to anything, I’d probably switch to Debian, but
  than again, I’ve never looked at Arch and it was recommended to me a few
  times.

<p>True enough though, that no one can tell what future will bring, and there
 may be some bizarre event which will make me use Gentoo.
