<p>CSS sprites aren’t anything new.  They have been around for years
    now, and are one of the methods to optimise website load time.
    The idea is to incorporate several images into a single bigger one
    and in this way decrease number of round trips between HTTP server
    and a browser.

  <p>In its traditional use, CSS sprites work as a replacement for
    images and cannot be used as a background.  But background is
    exactly how I’d implemented quote image left of long quotes and
    flags indicating language paragraph was written in, e.g.:

  <blockquote>
    <p>A few of the entries on my blog have text both in English and
      Polish.  On those, I use some simple icons to indicate which is
      which:
    <p class=plFlag>Polish flag on the left indicates paragraph is
      written in Polish.
    <p class=enFlag>Union Jack on the left indicates paragraph is
      written in English.
  </blockquote>

  <p>After a bit of playing around I finally figured out how to get
    this working, and even though there are some caveats, sprites can
    be used as a top-left no-repeat background image as well.

<!-- EXCERPT -->

<h2>Basics</h2>

  <p>Let’s start with the basics.  Like I’ve alluded above,
    sprites incorporate many images into a bigger one and use CSS to
    display only what is needed.  Take the below image with a
    roll-over image for example.

  <style>
    #html5 { width: 450px; }
    #html5, #html5 span { height: 100px; }
    #html5 span {
      display: inline-block;
      text-indent: 100%;
      overflow: hidden;
      background-image: url('/d/html5-sprite.jpg');
    }
    #spriteh {
      width: 74px;
    }
    #spritet {
      width: 52px;
      background-position: -74px 0;
    }
    #spritem {
      width: 90px;
      background-position: -126px 0;
    }
    #spritel {
      width: 96px;
      background-position: -216px 0;
    }
    #sprite5 {
      width: 138px;
      background-position: -312px 0;
    }
    #spriteh:hover {
      background-position: 0 -110px;
    }
    #spritet:hover {
      background-position: -74px -110px;
    }
    #spritem:hover {
      background-position: -126px -110px;
    }
    #spritel:hover {
      background-position: -216px -110px;
    }
    #sprite5:hover {
      background-position: -312px -110px;
    }
  </style>
  <div id=html5><span id=spriteh>H</span><span id=spritet>T</span><span id=spritem>M</span><span id=spritel>L</span><span id=sprite5>5</span></div>

  <p>Without sprites it would require 10 separate files but thanks to
    CSS one is enough.  HTML code is rather simple and
    unimpressive:

  <pre>
&lt;div id=&quot;html5&quot;&gt;&lt;span
id=&quot;spriteh&quot;&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
id=&quot;spritet&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
id=&quot;spritem&quot;&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
id=&quot;spritel&quot;&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
id=&quot;sprite5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>

  <p>In the absence of styles it simply spell ‘HTML5’ which is
    excellent.  To make an image out of those spans their dimension
    must be set, text content hidden, and background image added:

<pre>
#html5 { width: 500px; }
#html5, #html5 span { height: 100px; }

#html5 span {
  display: inline-block;
  text-indent: 100%;
  overflow: hidden;
  background-image: url('html5-sprite.jpg');
}

#spriteh { width:  74px; }
#spritet { width:  52px; }
#spritem { width:  90px; }
#spritel { width:  96px; }
#sprite5 { width: 188px; }
</pre>

  <p>So far it’s nothing more than a standard ‘replace text with
    a picture’ CSS trick.  Because of that, each span would display
    the image starting with its top-left corner, end result being
    a rather repetitive image of a letter ‘H’.

  <p>To solve this issue browser has to be told to start drawing the
    image from a different offset—that’s exactly
    what <code>background-position</code> property does.  With a bit more
    styling, the code is almost complete:

<pre>
#spritet { background-position:  -74px 0; }
#spritem { background-position: -126px 0; }
#spritel { background-position: -216px 0; }
#sprite5 { background-position: -312px 0; }</pre>

  <p>The way this works is simple really.  In abstract terms,
    a background image repeats indefinitely in all four directions and
    its top-left corner is aligned with element’s top-left corner.
    When rendering the page, browser takes the part of background that
    overlaps and uses it.

  <figure><img src=/d/html5-sprite-expl alt=""></figure>

  <p><code>background-position</code> property instructs it to shift the
    abstract background by given length and only <em>than</em> cut
    whatever overlaps with the element.  By setting position
    to <code>-126px</code>, the 127th pixel of the background image will
    be aligned with top-left corner of the element.

  <p>With that knowledge, getting roll-over effect is now trivial:

<pre>
#spriteh:hover { background-position:    0   -110px; }
#spritet:hover { background-position:  -74px -110px; }
#spritem:hover { background-position: -126px -110px; }
#spritel:hover { background-position: -216px -110px; }
#sprite5:hover { background-position: -312px -110px; }</pre>

  <p>Note that the big image has a ten-pixel gap between
    sprites.  It prevents pixels from adjacent sprites
    ‘bleeding’ over to the other images.

  <h2>A bit simpler method</h2>

  <p>The above method is the ‘normal’ one to use sprites, but in the
    case of the image presented here, there’s an easier way.  Instead
    of setting background image for each individual span element, it’s
     simpler to set background for the wrapping div element and
    cover with span’s only when they are hovered.  CSS code
    for that looks as follows:

<pre>
#html5, #html5 span { height: 100px; }
#html5 {
  width: 500px;
  background-image: url('html5-sprite.jpg');
}
#html5 span {
  display: inline-block;
  text-indent: 100%;
  overflow: hidden;
}
#spriteh {
  width: 74px;
  background-position: 0 -110px;
}
#spritet {
  width: 52px;
  background-position: -74px -110px;
}
#spritem {
  width: 90px;
  background-position: -126px -110px;
}
#spritel {
  width: 96px;
  background-position: -216px -110px;
}
#sprite5 {
  width: 188px;
  background-position: -312px -110px;
}
#html5 span:hover {
  background-image: url('html5-sprite.jpg');
}</pre>

  <h2>Using sprites for background</h2>

  <p>Let’s compare the above with a way to implement an icon in
    a top-left corner of an element:

<pre>
blockquote {
  background: url('…') no-repeat;
  padding: 0 26px;
  min-height: 20px;
}</pre>

  <p>The trick here is the <code>no-repeat</code> value which causes the
    background image to be painted only once.  This is contrary to the
    way sprites work where interesting part of the image is cropped
    thanks to the limited size of the element.  Trying to use an image
    with multiple sprites as a background would result in whatever is
    on the right or bottom of the icon to be shown as well.

  <p>Here’s the thing though, if there’s nothing on the right or below
    the icon, if it is the last thing in the sprites image, the above
    is no longer an issue.  This realisation makes it apparent that
    using a staircase-like image with nothing but transparent
    background below the diagonal, sprites <em>on</em> the diagonal
    can be used as a top-left no-repeat background icon.

  <figure><img src=/d/icon-sprites.png alt="" id=iconsprites></figure>
  <script src=/d/icon-sprites.js></script>

  <p>With that knowledge, the following styles can be constructed:

<pre>
blockquote, .plFlag, .enFlag {
  background: url('/d/s.png') no-repeat;
}
blockquote {
  background-position: -100px 0;
  min-height: 20px;
}
.plFlag {
  background-position: -50px -50px;
  text-indent: 22px;
}
.enFlag {
  background-position: -75px -25px;
  text-indent: 22px;
}</pre>

  <p>This technique can be extended in certain situations—either when
    the height or width of the element is specified.  In those
    situations, more icons can be present either on the right or below
    the sprite used as a background.

  <p>Certainly limited, but if there are only a few cases when this
    method needs to be used, it allows more images to be converted
    into sprites than previously expected.  And it’s what enabled me
    to convert all but one small images on this site to CSS
    sprites.
