<p>In <a href="/2017/psa-chmod/">an earlier entry</a> I’ve changed
  generated key file used for disk encryption from 4096 to meagre 64
  bytes.  I gave no mention of that adjustment considering it
  unimportant but have since been enquired about security of such
  a short password.

<p>Rest assured, a 64-byte key file is sufficient for any symmetric
  encryption (disk encryption being one example) and anything more
  does not improve security.

<p>Even a modest 100 bits should be enough for the most paranoid
  amongst us, according
  to <a href="https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/wikis/FrequentlyAskedQuestions">cryptsetup
  FAQ</a>.  64 bytes is five times as many and recall that difficulty
  of breaking an encryption grows exponentially with the size of the
  secret.

<p id=b1>Bet let’s crank it up to eleven.  The largest cryptosetup supports (and
  will
  likely <a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/6141/amount-of-simple-operations-that-is-safely-out-of-reach-for-all-humanity/6149#6149">ever
  need to support</a>) are 512-bit keys<a href=#f1><sup>†</sup></a>.  No matter how
  enormous encryption password is, ultimately at most 512 bits will be used.  In
  other words, if key file is bigger it becomes easier to attack the derived
  encryption key instead.

<p>And since
  <a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/6141/amount-of-simple-operations-that-is-safely-out-of-reach-for-all-humanity/6149#6149">brute-forcing
    512-bit key would require roughly 2<sup>287</sup> solar systems worth of
  energy</a>
  (or <a href="http://www.space.com/25959-how-many-stars-are-in-the-milky-way.html">2<sup>250</sup>
  Milky Way galaxies</a>) a motivated adversary will focus on
  <a href="https://xkcd.com/538/">other methods</a> of obtaining the
  password.

<p>There is a small caveat.  If the password was generated from a poor
  entropy source, instead of brute-forcing the encryption, guessing
  output of the pseudo random number generator should turn out much
  more rewarding.  This is precisely
  how <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/05/random_number_b.html">Debian’s
  OpenSSL vulnerability</a> came about.

<p>While it may be tempting to think a large file guards against such
  mishaps, PRNG is unable to concoct entropy.  Guessing its initial
  state (which in case of aforementioned vulnerability was only 31
  bits) is sufficient to predict its output to arbitrary length.

<p>This is why I’ve also changed the command to
  use <code>/dev/random</code> which gives better guarantees regarding
  randomness of its output compared to <code>/dev/urandom</code>.

<p>To sum up and reiterate, provided that good randomness source is
  used (hint: always use <code>/dev/random</code>), when creating
  a binary key file for a LUKS container, 64 bytes is plenty and even
  half of that is more than enough.

<p id=f1><a href=#b1><sup>†</sup></a> 512-bit encryption key is used for 256-bit block
  ciphers in XTS mode.  And even here the doubling of the size appears to be
  caused by misunderstanding of XEX algorithm rather than need for better
  security,
