<p>No, I haven’t gone completely mad yet and still, I write this as an appeal to
  stop using monospaced fonts for code <small>(conditions may apply)</small>.
  While fixed-width fonts have undeniable benefits when authoring software,
  their use is excessive and even detrimental in certain contexts.
  Specifically, when displaying inline code within a paragraph of text,
  proportional fonts are a better choice.

<p>Fixed-width fonts for inline code have a handful of downsides.  Firstly, text
  set in such font takes up more space and, depending on the font pairing,
  individual letters may appear larger.  This creates unbalanced look and
  opportunities for awkward line wrapping.

<p>Moreover, a fixed-width
  typeface <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/comparing-font-legibility/">has
  been shown to be slower to read</a>.  Even disregarding the speed differences,
  switching between two drastically different types of font isn’t comfortable.

<p>To make matters worse, many websites apply too many styles to inline code
  fragments.  For example GitHub and GitLab (i) change the font, (ii) decrease
  its size, (iii) add background and (iv) add padding.  This overemphasis
  detracts from the content rather than enhancing it.


<h2>A better way</h2>

<p id=b1>A better approach is using serif (sans-serif) font for the main text
  and a sans-serif (serif) font for inline code<sup><a href=#f1>1</a></sup>.
  If serifs aren’t one’s cup of tea, using a pairing allowing for clear
  differentiation between the main text and the code is possible even within the
  same font group.  For example pairing a humanist font with a complementary
  geometric font.

<p id=b2>Another option is to format code with a different colour.  To avoid
  using <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/use-of-color.html">it
  as the only mean of conveying information</a>, a subtle colour change may be
  used in conjunction with font change.  This is the approach I’ve taken on this
  blog<sup><a href=#f2>2</a></sup>.

<p>It’s also worth considering whether inline code even needs any kind of style
  change.  For example, the sentence ‘Execution of a C program starts from the
  main function’ is perfectly understandable whether or not ‘main’ is styled
  differently.


<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<p>What about code blocks?  Using proportional typefaces for them can be done
  with some care.  Indentation isn’t a major problem but some alignment may need
  adjustments.  Depending on the type of code listings, it may be an option.
  Having said that, I don’t claim this as the only correct option for web
  publishing.

<p>As an aside, what’s the deal with parenthesise after a function name?  To
  demonstrate, lets reuse an earlier example: ‘Execution of a C program starts
  from the <code>main()</code> function’.  The brackets aren’t part of the
  function name and unless they are used to disambiguate between multiple
  overloaded functions, there’s no need for them.

<p>To conclude, while fixed-width fonts have their place when writing code,
  their use in displaying inline code is often unnecessary.  Using
  a complementary pairing of proportional typefaces is a better options that can
  enhance readability.  Changing background of inline code is virtually never
  a good idea.

<p id=f1><a href=#b1>1</a> Using serif faces on websites used to carry risk of
  aliasing reducing legibility.  Thankfully, the rise of high DPI displays
  largely alleviated those concerns.

<p id=f2><a href=#b2>2</a> Combining colour change and typeface change breaks
  principle of using small style changes.  Nonetheless, I believe some leniency
  for websites is in order.  It’s not always guaranteed that readers will see
  fonts author has chosen making colour change kind of a backup.  Furthermore,
  compared to books, change in colour isn’t as focus-grabbing on the Internet.
