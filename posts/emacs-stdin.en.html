<p>One feature Emacs doesn’t have out of the box is reading data from standard
  input.  Trying to open <code>-</code> (e.g. <code>echo stdin | emacs -</code>)
  results in Emacs complaining about unknown option (if it ends up starting in
  graphical mode) or that ‘standard input is not a tty’ (when starting in
  terminal).

<p>With sufficiently advanced shell one potential solution is
  the <code>--insert</code> flag paired with command substitution: <code>echo
  stdin | emacs --insert &lt;(cat)</code>.  Sadly, it’s not a panacea.  It
  messes up initial buffer (and thus may break setups with
  custom <code>initial-buffer-choice</code>) and doesn’t address the issue of
  standard input not being a tty when running Emacs in terminal.

<p>For me the biggest problem though is that it isn’t available when using
  emacsclient.  Fortunately, as <a href=/2021/emacs-remote/#security>previously
  mentioned</a> the Emacs Server protocol allows for far more than just
  instructions to open a file.  Indeed, my solution to the problem revolves
  around the use of <code>--eval</code> option:

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;

my @args = @ARGV;
if (!@args) {
	my $data;
	$data = join '', &lt;STDIN&gt;;
	$data =~ s/\\/\\\\/g;
	$data =~ s/"/\\"/g;
	$data = &lt;&lt;ELISP;
(let ((buf (generate-new-buffer "*stdin*")))
  (switch-to-buffer buf)
  (insert "$data")
  (goto-char (point-min))
  (x-focus-frame nil)
  (buffer-name buf))
ELISP
	@args = ('-e', $data);
}

exec 'emacsclient', @args;
die "emacsclient: $!\n";
</pre>

<p>People allergic to Perl may find this Python version more palatable:

<!-- FULL -->

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/python3

import os
import re
import sys

args = sys.argv[1:]
if not args:
        data = sys.stdin.read()
        data = data.replace('\\', '\\\\').replace('"', '\\"')
        data = ('(let ((buf (generate-new-buffer "*stdin*")))'
                '(switch-to-buffer buf)'
                '(insert "' + data + '")'
                '(goto-char (point-min))'
                '(x-focus-frame nil)'
                '(buffer-name buf))')
        args = ('-e', data)

os.execlp('emacsclient', 'emacsclient', *args)
</pre>

<p>Usage is straightforward.  When called without arguments, the script will
  read standard input and insert it’s content into a fresh <code>*pipe*</code>
  Emacs buffer.  When called with arguments, they are passed unchanged to
  emacsclient.

<p>This isn’t the only approach of course and it is limited to how large the
  input can be.  On Linux the maximum it can cope is roughly 131 kB.  That
  should be plenty for many use cases but it case it’s not a different way to
  deal with the issue would be to store standard input in a temporary file.
  While it may even be more efficient,
  I often <a href="/2021/emacs-remote-sshfs/">use Emacs from remote hosts</a>
  and not having to deal with path name confusion is an advantage of the above
  scripts.
