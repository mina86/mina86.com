<p>While cleaning <a href=http://tinyapps.sf.net>Tiny Applications
Collection</a> a little I’ve dropped both artificial intelligence
scripts.  However, not wanting to let them disappear, I’ve decided to
post them here for posterity.

<p>The first one is an eight line of code version that might just be
what <a href=http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=20001014>Sid
wrote</a> as his first program ever:

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -wWtT
while (&lt;&gt;) {
	if (/[aeiouyAEIOUY][^a-zA-Z]*$/) {
		print "Yes.\n";
	} elsif (!/^\s*$/) {
		print "No.\n";
	}
}</pre>

<p>The second one is an ‘improved’ six-line version akin to
<a href=http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=19990602>Pitr’s
code</a>:

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -wWtTn
if (/[aeiouyAEIOUY][^a-zA-Z]*$/) {
	print "No!\n";
} elsif (!/^\s*$/) {
	print "Yes.\n";
}</pre>

<!-- FULL -->

<p>Below is recreation of the scenes from UserFriendly comic strips:

<pre>
$ <i>./ai-sid.pl</i>
<i>Is it blue?</i>
Yes.
<i>Is it bigger than a breadbox?</i>
No.
<i>Is it smaller than a breadbox?</i>
No.
<i>Does it go wiki-wiki-wiki?</i>
Yes.
<i>^D</i>
$ <i>./ai-pitr.pl</i>
<i>Is my name Mike Floyd?</i>
Yes.
<i>Very clever Pitr is, Da?</i>
No!
^D</pre>

<p>Interestingly, both versions give opposite responses to the same
question.  Joining their standard inputs with standard outputs (as to
make them talk with each other) does not yield interesting results.
