<p>Anyone who uses a screen locker surely can recall a situation where they
  approached their computer and started typing their password to unlock it even
  though it was never locked.  Even if the machine is configured to lock
  automatically after a period of inactivity, there may be situations when power
  saving blanks the monitor even before the automatic locking happens.

<p>If one’s lucky, they realise their mistake in time before hitting Return in
  a chat window.  It’s not uncommon however that one ends with the password
  blasted into ether over IRC or Google Docs; lazy people might ignore the
  secret getting saved in their shell history file but even that should
  facilitate, often annoying, password change.

<p>What if I told you there’s a way to avoid those problems?  A one simple trick
  which will eliminated at least some forms of possible leaks.  Simply prefix
  all your passwords with <kbd>/!</kbd> (slash followed by an exclamation mark).

<!-- FULL -->


<h2>Slash</h2>

<p>Lines starting with a slash are treated as commands by many — though not
  all — chat applications.  This originated in IRC so virtually all IRC clients
  will do this, but the same feature was adopted by many other programs such as
  Element or Slack.  When trying to send a password beginning with a slash onto
  a channel or private conversation, the application will refuse to do anything
  reporting an unknown command.  For example:

<pre>
04:55 -!- Irssi: Unknown command: foobarbaz

[(status)] /foobarbaz
</pre>

<p>Of course even then the protection won’t work if there’s already some text in
  client’s input field; perhaps because one started writing something to send to
  the channel but got interrupted.


<h2>Exclamation mark</h2>

<p>Exclamation mark meanwhile has a special meaning in popular interactive
  shells (by which I mean bash since I’m too lazy to actually test any
  other shells).  When present the shell will attempt a history expansion (based
  on an arcane grammar that I reckon no one actually remembers).  If no
  expansion is found, rather than executing the command (and thus sending it
  into possibly world-readable history file) the shell will complain.  You can
  test it easily by trying to execute <code>echo !foobarbaz</code> in your
  shell:

<pre>
$ echo test
test
$ echo !foobarbaz
bash: !foobarbaz: event not found
$ echo !foobarbaz^C   <i># ‘echo !foobarbaz’ is populated by shell</i>
$ history | tail -n2
    6  echo test
    7  history | tail -n2
</pre>

<p>This doesn’t always work.  For example, if a non-letter follows the
  exclamation mark the expansion will likely succeed.
  The <code>histverify</code> shell option can help catch those errors.  (I’m
  again talking bash here but I assume other shells worth their weight in salt
  have similar option).  When it’s active, executing commands including a bang
  requires a confirmation after the history expansion happens.  In other words,
  pressing Return key once won’t execute them.  For example:

<pre>
$ shopt -s histverify
$ echo test
test
$ echo !$foobarbaz
$ echo testfoobarbaz^C   <i># ‘echo testfoobarbaz’ is populated by shell</i>
$ history | tail -n2
    8  echo test
    9  history | tail -n2
</pre>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>There are still places where the <kbd>/!</kbd> trick won’t work.  I’ve
  already mentioned chat applications which don’t recognise slash as a command
  prefix, but there are also tools for collaborative editing such as Google Docs
  which broadcast entered text as soon as a letter is pressed on the keyboard.
  (The former issue may be solved by
  using <a href="https://bitlbee.org/">bitlbee</a> for all instant messaging
  needs).

<p>Prefixing the password by <kbd>/!</kbd> isn’t a panacea but it may prevent at
  least some instances of accidental credentials exposure.  Since there’s
  virtually no cost in adopting this policy, why not do it?
