<p>Implementing Solana <a href="https://ibcprotocol.dev/">IBC</a> bridge, I had
  to deal with various constraints of the Solana protocol.  Connecting Solana
  to <a href="/2024/beware-composable-foundation/">Composable
  Foundation</a>’s <a href="https://picasso.network/">Picasso network</a>,
  I needed to develop an
  on-chain <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/light-clients/">light
  client</a> capable of validating Tendermint blocks.  This meant being able to
  validate 50 signatures in a single transaction.

<p>Turns out that’s not possible on Solana and it’s not exactly because of the
  execution time limit.  The real culprit is the transaction size limit which
  I’ve <a href="/2025/solana-tx-size-limits/">discussed previously</a>.  This
  article describes how signature verification is done on Solana, the limit on
  the number of signatures that can be verified in a single transaction and how
  that limit can be worked around.

<!-- FULL -->

<p>Like before, this article assumes familiarity with Solana and doesn’t serve
  as a step-by-step guide for Solana development.
  Nonetheless, <a href="https://github.com/mina86/solana-sigverify/tree/master/examples">examples
  from the <code>solana-sigverify</code> repository</a> can be used as
  a starting point when using the signature verification mechanism described
  below.


<h2>Cryptographic functions on Solana</h2>

<p>Solana programs can perform any computation a regular computer can do.  It is
  possible to implement cryptographic functions as part of a smart contract and
  have them executed on the blockchain.  However, that’s a quick way to run into
  issues.

<p>Calculating a 256-bit SHA2 digest of a 100-byte buffer takes 14
  thousand <a href="https://solana.com/docs/references/terminology#compute-units">compute
  units (CU)</a>.  Meanwhile, Solana programs
  have <a href="https://solana.com/docs/core/fees#compute-unit-limit">a hard
  limit of 1.4 million CU</a>.  In other words, hashing 100 bytes takes up 1% of
  the absolute maximum computation that a smart contract can perform in a single
  transaction.  Situation is even worse with more advanced cryptographic
  functions: a signature verification blows through the compute limit.

<p>Thankfully, Solana offers native methods for popular cryptographic
  primitives.  In particular, a <code>sol_sha256</code> system call (accessible
  through <a href="https://docs.rs/solana-program/1.18.26/solana_program/hash/fn.hashv.html"><code>solana_program::hash::hashv</code>
  function</a>) computes 256-bit SHA2 hash with cost of only 267 CU to hash
  a 100-byte buffer.  One might expect a similar <code>sol_ed25519_verify</code>
  system call, however signature verification is done in much more convoluted
  way on Solana.


<h3>Signature verification</h3>

<p id=b1>Solana includes a handful
  of <a href="https://docs.anza.xyz/runtime/programs">native programs</a>.
  Among those are programs, such as Ed25519 program, which perform signature
  verification.  To check a signature, caller creates a transaction including
  two instructions: one calling the native signature verification program and
  another calling a smart contract.  If a signature is invalid, the whole
  transaction fails an the smart contract is not
  called.<sup><a href=#f1>1</a></sup>

<p>For example,
  consider <a href="https://explorer.solana.com/tx/56QjWeDDDX4Re2sXs24r7eA2oWFN7wFCJHpTmy5uFHPKgcFhwi6mBnXyKzL3bAqSHoE9fmwJmFGJemswkEHybFC5">transaction
  56Qj&shy;WeDD&shy;DX4R&shy;e2sX…</a> which has three instructions: The first
  adjust compute unit limit, the second invokes the Ed25519 program and the
  final one calls a program which can check that signature has been verified.
  An annotated instruction data of the Ed25519 program invocation is shown
  below:

<h3>Signature count limit</h3>

<p id=b2>Since public key, signature and signed message are stored in the
  instruction data, number of signatures that can be verified is subject
  to <a href="https://solana.com/docs/core/transactions">the 1232-byte
  transaction size limit</a>.  Accounting for overhead leaves less than 1100
  bytes for the instruction data.  To specify a signature for verification,
  a 14-byte header, 32-byte public key, 64-byte signature and the message are
  needed.  Even assuming an empty message, that’s 110 bytes per signature which
  means at most ten signatures in a single
  transaction.<sup><a href=#f2>2</a></sup>

<p>For Solana IBC I needed to verify Tendermint block signatures.  Tendermint
  validators timestamp their signatures and as a result each signature is for
  a different message of about 112 bytes.  That gives a maximum of ⌊1100 / (14 +
  32 + 64 + 112)⌋ = 4 signatures per transaction.  Meanwhile, as mentioned at
  the start, I needed to verify about 50 of them.


<h2>The <code>sigverify</code> program</h2>

<p id=b3>To address this limitation, signatures can be verified in batches with
  results aggregated into a <dfn>signatures account</dfn> that can be inspected
  later on.<sup><a href=#f3>3</a></sup> This scheme needs i) a smart contract
  capable of doing the aggregation and ii) an interface for other smart
  contracts to interpret the aggregated data.

<p>The first point is addressed
  by <a href="https://github.com/mina86/solana-sigverify">the <code>sigverify</code>
  program</a>.  Using regular Solana way of signature verification, it observes
  what signatures have been checked in the transaction.  It then aggregates all
  that information into <a href="https://solana.com/docs/core/pda">a Program
  Derived Address (PDA) account</a> it owns.  As the owner, only
  the <code>sigverify</code> program can modify the account thus making sure
  that aggregated information stored in it is correct.

<p>Even though the <code>sigverify</code> owns the account, it internally
  assigns it to the signer such that users cannot interfere with each other’s
  signatures account.


<h2>RPC Client</h2>

<p>A convenient way to call the <code>sigverify</code> program is to use the
  client library functions packaged alongside it.  To use them, first add a new
  dependency to the RPC client (making sure <code>client</code> feature is
  enabled):

<pre>
[dependencies.solana-sigverify]
git = "https://github.com/mina86/solana-sigverify"
features = ["client"]
</pre>

<p>The crate has a <code>UpdateIter</code> iterator which generates instruction
  pairs that need to be executed to aggregate the signatures into the signatures
  account.  The account can be reused but in that case each batch of signatures
  needs to use a different <tt>epoch</tt>.  If account is freed each time, epoch
  can be set to <tt>None</tt>.  Note that all the instruction pairs returned
  by <code>UpdateIter</code> can be executed in parallel transactions.

<pre>
// <i>Generate list of signatures to verify.</i>
let entries: Vec&lt;Entry&gt; = signatures.iter()
    .map(|sig| Entry {
        pubkey: &amp;sig.pubkey,
        signature: &amp;sig.signature,
        message: &amp;sig.message,
    })
    .collect();

// <i>When signatures account is reused, each use needs</i>
// <i>a different epoch value.  Otherwise it can be </i>None<i>.</i>
let epoch = std::time::SystemTime::now()
    .duration_since(std::time::UNIX_EPOCH)
    .unwrap()
    .as_nanos() as u64;
let epoch = Some(epoch);

// <i>Generate all necessary instructions and send them to</i>
// <i>Solana.  </i>UpdateIter<i> splits signatures into groups as</i>
// <i>necessary to call </i>sigverify<i>.</i>
let (iter, signatures_account, signatures_bump) =
    solana_sigverify::instruction::UpdateIter::new(
        &amp;solana_sigverify::algo::Ed25519::ID,
        SIGVERIFY_PROGRAM_ID,
        signer.pubkey(),
        SIGNATURES_ACCOUNT_SEED,
        epoch,
        &amp;entries,
    )?;
// <i>To speed things up, all of those instruction pairs can</i>
// <i>be executed in parallel.</i>
for insts in iter {
    let blockhash = client.get_latest_blockhash()?;
    let message = Message::new_with_blockhash(
        &amp;insts,
        Some(&amp;signer.pubkey()),
        &amp;blockhash,
    );
    send_and_confirm_message(
        client, signer, blockhash, message)?;
}

// <i>Invoke the target smart contract. </i>signatures_account<i> is</i>
// <i>the account with aggregated signatures.  It will need to</i>
// <i>be passed to the smart contract.</i>
todo!("Invoke the target smart contract");

// <i>Optionally free the account.  Depending on usage, the</i>
// <i>account can be reused (to save minor amount of gas fees)</i>
// <i>with a new epoch as described.</i>
let instruction = solana_sigverify::instruction::free(
    SIGVERIFY_PROGRAM_ID,
    signer.pubkey(),
    Some(signatures_account),
    SIGNATURES_ACCOUNT_SEED,
    signatures_bump,
)?;
send_and_confirm_instruction(client, signer, instruction)?;
</pre>

<p>The signatures are aggregated into an account whose address is stored
  in <code>signatures_account</code>.  The <code>SIGNATURES_ACCOUNT_SEED</code>
  allows a single signer to maintain multiple accounts if necessary.


<h2>The target smart contract</h2>

<p>The target smart contract needs to be altered to support reading the
  aggregated signatures.  Code which helps with that is available in
  the <code>solana-sigverify</code> crate as well.  First, add a new dependency
  to the program (making sure <code>lib</code> feature is enabled)):

<pre>
[dependencies.solana-sigverify]
git = "https://github.com/mina86/solana-sigverify"
features = ["lib"]
</pre>

<p>The crate has a <code>Verifier</code> family of types which can interface
  with the Solana’s native signature verification programs (like the Ed25519
  program) and the aggregated signatures.  This flexibility allows the smart
  contracts using this type to nearly transparently support normal Solana
  signature verification method or the signature aggregation
  through <code>sigverify</code> program.

<pre>
/// <i>Address of the sigverify program.  This must be set</i>
/// <i>correctly or the signature verification won’t work.</i>
const SIGVERIFY_PROGRAM_ID: Pubkey =
    solana_program::pubkey!("/* <i>…</i> */");

let mut verifier =
    solana_sigverify::Ed25519Verifier::default();

// <i>To check signatures from a call to a native signature</i>
// <i>verification program, the verifier must be initialised</i>
// <i>with Instructions sysvar.  The the native program call</i>
// <i>must immediately preceding the current instruction.</i>
let instructions_sysvar = /* <i>…</i> */;
verifier.set_ix_sysvar(instructions_sysvar)?;

// <i>To check signatures aggregated in a signatures account,</i>
// <i>the verifier must be initialised with the account.  For</i>
// <i>security, expected sigverify program ID must be specified</i>
// <i>as well.  verifier rejects signatures accounts not owned</i>
// <i>by the sigverify program.</i>
let signatures_account = /* <i>…</i> */;
verifier.set_sigverify_account(
    account, &amp;SIGVERIFY_PROGRAM_ID)?;

// <i>To verify a signature, call </i>verify<i> method.</i>
if !verifier.verify(message, pubkey, signature)? {
    panic!("Signature verification failed");
}
</pre>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>It’s perhaps counter intuitive that the transaction size limit constraints
  how many signatures can be verified in a single Solana transaction, but
  because of the design of the native signature verification programs, it is
  indeed the case.  Thankfully, with some engineering the restriction can be
  worked around.

<p>This article introduces a method of aggregating signatures across multiple
  transactions with the help of a <code>sigverify</code> program and library
  functions available
  in <a href="https://github.com/mina86/solana-sigverify"><code>solana-sigverify</code>
  repository</a>.  The library code supports regular Solana signature
  verification method as well as the aggregated signatures providing flexibility
  to the smart contract.

<p>Lastly, the repository also provides <code>solana-native-sigverify</code>
  crate which offers APIs for interacting with the Solana native signature
  verification programs.


<p id=f1><a href=#b1>1</a> The native signature verification programs cannot
  be called through <a href="https://solana.com/docs/core/cpi">Cross Program
  Invocation (CPI)</a> making the whole mechanism a bit convoluted.  The smart
  contract must inspect the transaction to make sure that the signature
  verification has happened which by itself is non-trivial.  Thankfully,
  <a href="https://github.com/mina86/solana-sigverify/">the <code>solana-native-sigverify</code>
  crate</a> includes helper function for interacting with native signature
  verification programs such as Ed25519 program or Secp255k1 program.

<p id=f2><a href=#b2>2</a> With specially crafted messages it is possible to
  go past that limit.  If the same public key is used, 13 signatures can fit in
  single transaction (⌊(1100 - 32) / (14 + 64)⌋ = 13).  However, that’s an
  unrealistic scenario especially considering that any useful transaction needs
  to include another instruction.

<p id=f3><a href=#b3>3</a> Note that ‘aggregate’ here doesn’t mean
  zero-knowledge aggregation.  Rather, all the verified signatures are stored in
  the signatures account so another programs can see whether some particular
  signature has been aggregated.  More specifically, as an optimisation,
  a <code>sha256(algorithm || pubkey || signature || message)</code> hashes are
  stored.  This is sufficient to check whether particular known signature was
  verified.
