<p>It has been pointed out to me that my website does not open on some
web browsers due to XML error.  This undesired state was caused by the
<code>&amp;nbsp;</code> entity that XML does not define by itself.  I have
noticed this some time ago and thus switched to numeric notation
(<code>&amp;#160;</code>) but the named entity still prevailed in a few
places.

<p>Interestingly, I was unable to reproduce the error myself but
nonetheless I have seen it happen on my friend’s computer so this was
a real issue.

<p>I’m writing “was” because I got rid of all occurrences of the
<code>&amp;nbsp;</code> entity so this problem should not affect anyone
anymore.  Had you been affected by this problem, consider
revisiting. :)

<p>I’m also extremely grateful for reporting any problems either via
email (<b>mina86</b> <i>at</i> <a
href=http://mina86.com>mina86.com</a>), jabber (<b>mina86</b>
<i>at</i> <a href=http://jabber.org>jabber.org</a>)
or on IRC (<b>mina86</b> on FreeNode network).
