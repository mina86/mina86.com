<p>I’ve been reading tutorials on using key-files for disk encryption.  Common
  approach for generating such files is to create it using something similar
  to <code>head -c 4096 /dev/urandom &gt;key-file</code> and only then change
  it’s permissions (usually with a plain <code>chmod 400 key-file</code>) to
  prevent others from reading it.

<p><em>Please</em>, stop doing this and spreading that method.  The correct way
  of achieving the effect is:

<pre>(umask 077; head -c 64 /dev/random &gt;key-file)</pre>

<p>Or if the file needs to be created as root while command is run by
  a different user:

<pre>sudo sh -c 'umask 077; head -c 64 /dev/random &gt;key-file'</pre>

<p id=b2>The first method creates the file as
  world-readable<a href=/self#f2>†</a> and before its permission are
  changed <em>anyone</em> can read it.  The second method creates the file as
  readable only by its owner from the very beginning thus preventing the secret
  disclosure.

<!-- EXCERPT -->

<p>This attack is possible even if data is written after permissions
  are tightened.  For example in situation such as:

<pre>
exec 3&gt;key-file
chmod 400 key-file
head -c 64 /dev/random >&amp;3
exec 3&gt;&amp;-
</pre>

<p>Changing file permissions does not affect existing file descriptors
  so if attacker opens the file prior to the invocation of
  <code>chmod</code> command they can keep it open and wait for the
  data to trickle in.

<p>This may sound like a theoretical exercise which has no barring on
  reality but the proper way of doing things is so trivial there’s no
  reason not to go with it.  Indeed, it’s actually <em>shorter</em>.

<p id=f2><a href=#b2>†</a> This does depend on various factors.  For example
  whether the directory the file is created in has executable bit set.
  Some <del>paranoid</del> security-conscious users may already have
  <code>umask</code> set to <code>077</code> but beware
  that <code>sudo</code> resets it to the default <code>022</code>.

<p>PS. If anyone wonders while I also changed the key-file’s size from 4096 to
  just 64 bytes I’ve <a href="/2017/key-file-size/">explained it in another
  article</a>.
