<p>I’ve been reading tutorials on using key files for disk encryption.
  Common approach for creating such a file is:

<blockquote style="background-color: #fcc; border-radius: 0.5em">
  <p>Step 1: Create a random key file
  <pre>head -c 4096 /dev/urandom &gt;keyfile</pre>
  <p>Step 2: Make the file readable by owner only
  <pre>chmod 400 keyfile</pre>
</blockquote>

<p><i>*sighs*</i> <em>Please</em>, stop doing this and spreading that
  method.  The correct way of achieving the effect is:

<blockquote>
  <p>Step 1: Create a random key file readable by owner only
  <pre>(umask 077; head -c 64 /dev/random &gt;keyfile)</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Or if the file needs to be created as root while command is run by
  a different user:

<blockquote>
  <p>Step 1: Create a random key file readable by root only
  <pre>sudo sh -c 'umask 077; head -c 64 /dev/random &gt;keyfile'</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The first method creates the file as world-readable† and before its
  permission are changed <em>anyone</em> can read it.  The second
  method creates the file as readable only by its owner from the very
  beginning thus preventing the secret disclosure.

<!-- EXCERPT -->

<p>This attack is possible even if data is written after permissions
  are tightened.  For example in situation such as:

<pre>
exec 3&gt;keyfile
chmod 400 keyfile
head -c 64 /dev/random >&amp;3
exec 3&gt;&amp;-
</pre>

<p>Changing file permissions does not affect existing file descriptors
  so if attacker opens the file prior to the invocation of
  <code>chmod</code> command they can keep it open and wait for the
  data to trickle in.

<p>This may sound like a theoretical exercise which has no barring on
  reality but the proper way of doing things is so trivial there’s no
  reason not to go with it.  Indeed, it’s actually <em>shorter</em>.

<p>† This does depend on various factors.  For example whether the
  directory the file is created in has executable bit set.
  Some <del>paranoid</del> security-conscious users may already have
  <code>umask</code> set to <code>077</code> but beware
  that <code>sudo</code> resets it to the default <code>022</code>.
