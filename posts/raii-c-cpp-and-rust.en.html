<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTMvh6VzDls">a recent
    Computerphile video</a>, Ian Knight talked about RAII idiom and it’s
    application in C++ and Rust.  While the video described the general
    concepts, I felt different examples could be more clearly convey essence of
    the topic.

<p>I’ve decided to give my own explanation to hopefully better illustrate what
  RAII is and how it relates to Rust’s ownership.  Then again, for whatever
  reason I’ve decided to write it as a play with dialogue in faux Old English so
  it may well be even more confusing instead.

<h2>Aforeword</h2>

<p>A thing to keep in mind is that the examples are somewhat contrived.  For
  example, the buffer and file object present in <code>read_double</code>
  function can easily live on the stack.  A real-life code wouldn’t bother
  allocating them on the heap.  Then again, I could see a beginner make
  a mistake of trying to bypass <code>std::unique_ptr</code> not having a copy
  constructor by creating objects on heap and passing pointers around.

<p>In the end, is this better explanation than the one in aforementioned
  Computerphile video?  I’d argue code examples represent discussed concepts
  better though to be honest form of presentation hinders clarity of
  explanation.  Yet, I had too much fun messing around with this post so here it
  is in this form.

<p>Lastly, I don’t know Old English so the dialogue is probably incorrect.  I’m
  happy to accept corrections but otherwise I don’t care that much.  One
  shouldn’t take this post too seriously.
