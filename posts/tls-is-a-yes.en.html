<p id=b3><a href=https://letsencrypt.org//2016/04/12/leaving-beta-new-sponsors.html>Let’s
Encrypt has left beta</a> and to celebrate, <a href=/>this blog gained TLS
support</a>. \o/ If all goes well
<a href=/2013/ssl-and-dropping-www-with-mod-rewrite/>it’ll become the
default</a> including an

<p>If you’re unfamiliar with <a href=https://letsencrypt.org/>Let’s
  Encrypt</a>, it’s a certificate authority which provides free TLS
  certificates.  It uses automated process to verify whether
  certificate’s requestor controls the domain certificate is for and
  takes literally seconds to complete.

<p>Its sponsors include Mozilla and Google which means that Let’s
  Encrypt’s certificate is included in those browsers as well as many
  other software packages and operating systems.

<p>With nearly zero cost for getting a widely accepted certificate,
  another obstacle for encrypted web is crumbling.  And not a moment
  too soon since aforementioned
  <a href=https://konklone.com/post/were-deprecating-http-and-its-going-to-be-okay>Mozilla
  and Chrome duo plan to ‘deprecate’ plain HTTP</a>.

<p>If you’re running your own server there’s
  <a href=https://istlsfastyet.com/>no excuse not to use TLS</a> and
  if you’re hosting provider doesn’t support it, complain and do it
  loudly.

<p id=f3><a href=#b3>†</a> Especially paranoid readers surely noticed the site
  uses third-party widgets but those same readers are expected to know how to
  install <a href=https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock>uBlock Origin</a>.
