<p>In a past life <a href="/2010/prime-numbers-less-than-a-hundred/">I’ve talked
    about</a> a challenge to write the shortest program which prints all prime
    numbers less than a hundred.  Back then I’ve discussed a 60-character long
    solution written in C.  Since Rust is the future, inspired
    by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/o1i3d2/prime_number_generator_in_rust_664579_primes/">a recent
    thread on Sieve of Eratosthenes</a> I’ve decided to carry the task for Rust
    as well.

<p>To avoid spoiling the solution, I’m padding this article with a bit of
  unrelated content.  To jump straight to the code, skip the next block of
  paragraphs.  Otherwise, here’s a joke for ya:

<blockquote>
  <p>After realising he got lost, a man in a hot air balloon spotted a woman
    below.  He descended and shouted, ‘Excuse me, can you help me?  I’ve
    promised a friend I would meet him an hour ago, but I don’t know where
    I am.’
  <p>The woman below looked up and replied matter-of-factly, ‘You are in a hot
    air balloon hovering around ten metres above the ground.  You are between 47
    and 48 degrees north latitude and between 8 and 9 degrees east longitude.’
  <p>‘You must be an engineer,’ the balloonist concluded.
  <p>‘I am,’ the woman replied intrigued, ‘How did you know?’
  <p>‘Well, everything you told me is technically correct, but I have no idea
    how to use your information and I am still lost.  Frankly, you’ve not been
    much help.’
  <p>The woman pondered for a while and responded, ‘You must be in
    management.’
  <p>‘I am,’ the man confirmed, ‘but how did you know?’
  <p>‘Well, you don’t know where you are or where you are going, you have risen
    to where you are thanks to hot air, you made a promise which you have no
    idea how to keep and you expect people beneath you to solve your problems.
    The fact is you are in exactly the same position you were in before we met,
    but now, somehow, it’s my fault!’
</blockquote>

<h2>The solution</h2>

<p>Now back to the matter at hand.  Let’s first go with a 68-character long
  solution I came up with.  It is as follows:

<pre>fn main(){for n in 2..99{if(2..n).all(|k|n%k!=0){println!("{}",n)}}}</pre>

<p>For comparison, here’s the aforementioned C variant:

<pre>main(i,j){for(;j=++i&lt;99;j&lt;i||printf("%d\n",i))for(;i%++j;);}</pre>

<p>Let’s break it down a little taking this opportunity to talk about Rust.

<p>Commonality between the two variants is lack of type declarations.  It’s
  important to note that, while in C this was due to (since deprecated) rule
  that variables are implicitly integers, Rust performs type inference.  In many
  situations in Rust there’s no need to declare types and the compiler will
  figure out the correct one.

<p>Rust doesn’t have a C-style <code>for</code> syntax and offers range loop
  instead.  <code>for n in 2..99 { <var>body</var> }</code> will execute body
  with <code>n</code> variable ranging from 2 to 98 inclusively.  Since 99 is
  not a prime, we don’t need to include it in the range.  By the
  way, <code>2..99</code> is not part of the syntax for the loop; rather, it
  declares a range object.  And yes, ranges are right-open (though there’s also
  syntax for closed intervals).

<p><code>|<var>args</var>| <var>expr</var></code> is Rust’s syntax for lambdas
  (also known as anonymous functions).  I’m not a fan of the pipe characters in
  there — I’d much rather have Haskell’s syntax instead — but it’s something one
  can get used to.

<p>The <code>n % k != 0</code> expression demonstrates Rust
  dosn’t <a href="/2021/explicit-isnt-better-than-implicit/">implicitly</a>
  convert integers to booleans.  In fact, the exclamation mark unary operator
  performs binary (not logical) negation when applied to integer types.  That’s
  something tilde does in C.  Tilde used to declare boxed types and values in
  Rust but is now unused.

<p>Perhaps due to quirk of history, ranges in Rust are iterators (as opposed to
  merely
  implementing <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.IntoIterator.html"><code>IntoIterator</code>
  trait</a>) which means that methods such as <code>all</code> are available on
  them.  <code>all</code>, of course, checks whether all elements satisfy the
  predicate given as argument.  This means
  that <code>(2..n).all(<var>predicate</var>)</code> will test
  the <var>predicate</var> for all integers from 2 to n-1 inclusively (again,
  ranges are right-open unless different operator is used).

<p>And
    finally, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.println.html"><code>println!</code></a>
    is rather self-explanatory.  For people interested in the future, it’s worth
    noting that
    if <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2795-format-args-implicit-identifiers.html"><code>format_args_implicits</code>
    feature</a> gets stabilised, the code will be shortened by one more
    character.


<h2>67-character solution?</h2>

<p>There is a way to reach 67 characters.  It’s much more boring and I’m not
  sure if it’s in the spirit of the challenge.  The trick is to hard-code the
  list of primes as a byte buffer.  It’s not pretty, but it works:

<pre>
fn main(){for n in b"&#2;&#3;&#5;&#7;&#11;\r&#17;&#19;&#23;&#29;&#31;%)+/5;=CGIOSYa"{println!("{}",n)}}
</pre>

<p>Note that your user agent may fail to display control characters present in
  the above listing.  Copying and pasting should work though.

<p>The <code>b</code> sigil in front of the string is necessary to declare
  a byte-array rather than a <code>str</code> object.  The latter cannot be
  iterated over without invoking <code>bytes</code> or <code>chars</code> method
  which would make the solution too long.
