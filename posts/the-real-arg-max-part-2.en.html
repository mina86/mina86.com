<p>In <a href="/2021/the-real-arg-max-part-1/">part one</a> we’ve looked at
  the <code>ARG_MAX</code> parameter on Linux-based systems.  We’ve established
  experimentally how it affects arguments passed programs and what influences
  the value.  This time, we’ll look directly at the source to verify our
  findings and see how the limit looks from the point of view of system
  libraries and kernel itself.

<h2>C system library</h2>

<p>Application get value of the <code>ARG_MAX</code> parameter from
  the <code>sysconf</code> function.  It’s what the <code>getconf</code> utility
  uses to report the limit.  But even though the result of the function is
  closely related to the kernel, looking for its definition in the Linux source
  code is an exercise in futility.  Rather, the function is defined in the
  C system library which, in GNU/Linux distributions, is commonly providedy by
  the glibc package.

<p>glibc is a cross-platform library which supports many kernels and
  architectures.  It often includes multiple definitions of the same function
  each tailored for particular platform — such is the case
  with <code>sysconf</code>.  Thankfully, our analysis is limited to Linux and
  we can limit ourselves to just one of them.  In glibc 2.33, the implementation
  we’re interested in is located
  in <code>sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/sysconf.c</code> file and looks as follows:

<pre>
#define legacy_ARG_MAX 131072

<i>/* […] */</i>

long int
__sysconf (int name)
{
  const char *procfname = NULL;

  switch (name)
    {
      <i>/* […] */</i>

    case _SC_ARG_MAX:
      {
        struct rlimit rlimit;
        /* Use getrlimit to get the stack limit.  */
        if (__getrlimit (RLIMIT_STACK, &amp;rlimit) == 0)
	  return MAX (legacy_ARG_MAX, rlimit.rlim_cur / 4);

        return legacy_ARG_MAX;
      }

      <i>/* […] */</i>
    }

  return posix_sysconf (name);
}
</pre>

<p>This code explains discrepancies we’ve observed
  when <a href="/2021/the-real-arg-max-part-1/#bigstack">testing large stack
  size limit</a>.  While glibc implements the 128 KiB lower bound it’s unaware
  of the 6 MiB upper bound.  Since <code>getconf</code> utility relies
  on <code>sysconf</code> library function, having the above implementation
  means that for large stacks the tool will wrongly report <code>ARG_MAX</code>
  as quarter of maximum stack size.

<p>glibc isn’t the only library used on Linux systems.  Others have their
  own <code>sysconf</code> implementations which may return different values.
  uClibc-ng 1.0.38 behaves the same way glibc does while bionic 10.0, dietlibc
  0.34 and musl 1.2 return 128 KiB as <code>ARG_MAX</code>.

<p>The good news is that situation with glibc is about to improve.  My
  recent <a href="https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commitdiff;h=a9880586eedb3ba89ca6a7c5e3f0664c279cf636">commit
  updating <code>sysconf</code> implementation</a> makes the function aware of
  the 6 MiB upper bound.  Once the change finds its way into a glibc release,
  the library will report <code>ARG_MAX</code> correctly even for large stacks.


<h2>Linux kernel</h2>

<p>On the kernel side, we want to look at the <code>execve</code> system call.
  Like all other system calls, it is defined using
  a <code>SYSCAL_DEFINE<var>n</var></code> macro.  It doesn’t take long to find
  its implementation in <code>fs/exec.c</code> file.  In Linux 5.11.11 it looks
  as follows:

<pre>
SYSCALL_DEFINE3(execve,
		const char __user *, filename,
		const char __user *const __user *, argv,
		const char __user *const __user *, envp)
{
	return do_execve(getname(filename), argv, envp);
}
</pre>

<p>Definition of <code>do_execve</code> can be found just a few lines earlier in
  the same file.  All it does is call <code>do_execveat_common</code> function
  so that’s what we’re going to take a closer look at.  It is where most of the
  checks and calculations happen:

<pre>
static int do_execveat_common(int fd, struct filename *filename,
			      struct user_arg_ptr argv,
			      struct user_arg_ptr envp,
			      int flags)
{
	struct linux_binprm *bprm;
	int retval;
	<i>/* […] */</i>

	retval = count(argv, MAX_ARG_STRINGS);
	if (retval &lt; 0)
		goto out_free;
	bprm->argc = retval;

	retval = count(envp, MAX_ARG_STRINGS);
	if (retval &lt; 0)
		goto out_free;
	bprm->envc = retval;

	retval = bprm_stack_limits(bprm);
	if (retval &lt; 0)
		goto out_free;

	retval = copy_string_kernel(bprm->filename, bprm);
	if (retval &lt; 0)
		goto out_free;
	bprm->exec = bprm->p;

	retval = copy_strings(bprm->envc, envp, bprm);
	if (retval &lt; 0)
		goto out_free;

	retval = copy_strings(bprm->argc, argv, bprm);
	if (retval &lt; 0)
		goto out_free;

	retval = bprm_execve(bprm, fd, filename, flags);

	<i>/* […] */</i>
	return retval;
}
</pre>

<p>The two invocations to <code>count</code> function calculate number of
  command line arguments and environment variables.  Each call may fail if the
  number exceeds <code>MAX_ARG_STRINGS</code>.  Technically speaking this is
  another limit but in practice the constant is over two billion and, as we’ll
  see later, there is no way to reach this number without reaching other limits
  first.  The only other situation in which <code>count</code> function may
  return an error is in case of memory fault, but that’s not interesting for our
  analysis.


<h3>Limit calculation</h3>

<p><code>bprm_stack_limits</code> is where the actual calculation happens.  The
  function determines the limit and stores it in the <code>bprm</code>
  structure.  It’s defined as follows:

<pre>
static int bprm_stack_limits(struct linux_binprm *bprm)
{
	unsigned long limit, ptr_size;

	limit = _STK_LIM / 4 * 3;
	limit = min(limit, bprm->rlim_stack.rlim_cur / 4);
	limit = max_t(unsigned long, limit, ARG_MAX);

	ptr_size = (bprm->argc + bprm->envc) * sizeof(void *);
	if (limit &lt;= ptr_size)
		return -E2BIG;
	limit -= ptr_size;

	bprm->argmin = bprm->p - limit;
	return 0;
}
</pre>

<p><code>_STK_LIM</code> is the default stack size limit and equals 8 MiB.  The
  first expression in the function is what introduces the upper bound of 6 MiB
  for arguments.  It’s worth noting that it’s a relatively new restriction
  introduced in Linux 4.13 (and later back-ported to previous releases).  Why
  it’s there might be a story for another time.

<p>The second expression in the function is what implements the ‘quarter of the
  stack size’ rule.  This is what could be called a ‘normal’ case and definitely
  is most typical of common desktop and server configurations.  With default
  maximum stack size limit being 8 MiB the default limit for executable
  arguments ends up being 2 MiB.

<p>The third expression sets the limit to be no less than
  the <code>ARG_MAX</code>.  This gets a bit confusing.  <code>ARG_MAX</code> is
  supposed to be a dynamic value and here we see a constant of the same name.
  As often is the case, the explanation lays in the past.  Historically the
  value was constant and defined as a macro in kernel headers.  Eventually,
  a more dynamic approach was introduced but the definition of the macro stuck.
  To maintain backwards-compatibility, the dynamic calculation kept the old
  static value as a lower bound.

<p>The last adjustment in the function is to reserve space for
  the <code>argv</code> and <code>envp</code> arrays.  If the limit cannot
  accommodate them the function returns an error; otherwise the limit is reduced
  by the necessary space.  This is where we can see that the limit of two
  billion arguments and environment variables (imposed by the <code>count</code>
  function called in <code>do_execveat_common</code>) can never be reached.
  With a 6 MiB upper bound for the limit, the most one could hope for is 1.25
  million arguments and that’s only on a 32-bit system with all strings empty.

<p>The calculated limit is finally stored in <code>argmin</code> field of
  the <code>bprm</code> structure.  It specifies the lowest address at which
  arguments can still be stored and the value will be checked later on when
  program executable path, environment variables and command line arguments are
  copied.  Recall that stack grows downward which is why the field specifies the
  minimum and why it’s calculated by subtracting the argument size limit from
  the current top of the stack (specified by <code>bprm->p</code>).


<h3>Copying strings</h3>

<p>Finally, <code>do_execveat_common</code> checks the lengths of the strings
  while copying them to the new program’s memory.  First, the path to program’s
  executable is transferred with the help of <code>copy_string_kernel</code>
  function which is defined as follows:

<pre>
int copy_string_kernel(const char *arg, struct linux_binprm *bprm)
{
	int len = strnlen(arg, MAX_ARG_STRLEN) + 1 <i>/* terminating NUL */</i>;
	unsigned long pos = bprm->p;

	if (len == 0)
		return -EFAULT;
	if (!valid_arg_len(bprm, len))
		return -E2BIG;

	arg += len;
	bprm->p -= len;
	if (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_MMU) && bprm->p &lt; bprm->argmin)
		return -E2BIG;

	<i>/* [… copy the string …] */</i>
	<i>/* [… analogous to memcpy(bprm->p, arg, len); …] */</i>

	return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>Firstly, <code>strnlen</code> paired with call to <code>valid_arg_len</code>
  checks whether the string exceeds <code>MAX_ARG_STRLEN</code> bytes (or
  128 KiB).  <code>valid_arg_len</code> is a trivial inline function whose body
  simply states <code>return len &lt;= MAX_ARG_STRLEN;</code>.  If the size of
  the string exceeds the limit, argument list is deemed too long and the
  function returns an error.

<p>Then, the function checks if there’s enough space on stack to fit the string.
  This is done by moving the stack pointer downwards
  (i.e. subtracting <code>len</code> from <code>bprm->p</code> field) to reserve
  memory for the argument and checking whether the new position of the edge of
  the stack crossed the limit (by checking if <code>bprm->p &lt;
  bprm->argmin</code>).  If so, argument list is to long.  Otherwise the
  argument is copied onto the stack.

<p>The <code>copy_strings</code> function which <code>do_execveat_common</code>
  function calls to transfer environment variables and command line arguments is
  entirely analogous.  The two differences are that i) source data lives in
  user-space and ii) the function operates in a loop copying a sequence of
  strings.

<pre>
static int copy_strings(int argc, struct user_arg_ptr argv,
			struct linux_binprm *bprm)
{
	<i>/* […] */</i>
	int ret;

	while (argc-- > 0) {
		const char __user *str;
		int len;
		unsigned long pos;

		ret = -EFAULT;
		str = get_user_arg_ptr(argv, argc);
		if (IS_ERR(str))
			goto out;

		len = strnlen_user(str, MAX_ARG_STRLEN);
		if (!len)
			goto out;

		ret = -E2BIG;
		if (!valid_arg_len(bprm, len))
			goto out;

		pos = bprm->p;
		str += len;
		bprm->p -= len;
		if (bprm->p &lt; bprm->argmin)
			goto out;

		<i>/* [… copy the string …] */</i>
		<i>/* [… analogous to memcpy(bprm->p, str, len); …] */</i>
	}
	ret = 0;
out:
	<i>/* […] */</i>
	return ret;
}
</pre>

<p>Having to read from user-space complicates the function, though much of that
  complexity has been hidden from the listing above in the elided code.  The
  visible parts are calls to <code>get_user_arg_ptr</code>
  and <code>strnlen_user</code> instead of <code>strnlen</code>.

<p>The parts that interests us remain the same: the <code>valid_arg_len</code>
  call and the <code>bprm->p &lt; bprm->argmin</code> comparison.


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This concludes the investigation.  In the previous article we’ve seen how the
  argument length limit affects user-space, here we looked at the source code of
  the kernel to confirm our previous findings.  There are still a few minor
  mysteries — such as why the 6 MiB exists or what happens if maximum stack size
  is less that 128 KiB — which I may tackle at another time.

<p>It remains important to remember that our findings are true for Linux only.
  Other kernels will set the limit differently and count different things
  towards it.  POSIX leaves the details purposefully vague.  As a result
  a portable application may struggle to interpret the limit; it should not only
  take value of <code>ARG_MAX</code> with a grain of salt but ideally also
  recover from <code>E2BIG</code> error by reducing number of arguments.

<p>Fortunately, UNIX-like systems provide a simple solution in the form
  of <code>xargs</code> and <code>find … -exec … +</code> commands.  Those
  should be much easier to use and sufficient for most cases.  They will
  typically know how to deal with the command’s argument size limit.

<p>Whatever the case may be, I hope this article has been informative and
  provided further understanding of the kernel and it’s interaction with
  user-space}.
