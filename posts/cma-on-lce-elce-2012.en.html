<p>LinuxCon / Embedded Linux Conference Europe 2012 is nearly over,
and I had a pleasure of talking about the Contiguous Memory Allocator.
The slides from the talk are embedded below, are <a
href="https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B_axg5vW_1lgdUhZazNCOVVPZms">available
for download</a> from Google Drive, and <a
href=https://github.com/mina86/linux-cma/tree/lce>their source code</a>
can be accessed at GitHub.

<p>Unfortunately, in contrast to other LCE/ELCE conferences, talks
were not recorded, so the video of the presentation is not
available.

<p>For more links regarding CMA, I have set up a resource page at <a
href="https://mina86.com/cma/">mina86.com/cma/</a>.  Beside the link to
the final CMA patchset and to the LCE/ELCE presentation, it links to
various articles and patches relating to CMA directly or
indirectly.
