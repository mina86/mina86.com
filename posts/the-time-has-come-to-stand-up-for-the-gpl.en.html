<p>For people who know me it should come with no surprise that I support free
  software in most forms it can take.  I also believe that if someone gives you
  something at zero price, basic courtesy dictates that you follow wishes of
  that person.  This is why when <a href=http://sfconservancy.org/>Software
  Freedom Conservancy</a> started
  a <a href=http://sfconservancy.org/linux-compliance/>GPL Compliance Project
  for Linux Developers</a> I didn’t hesitate even for a minute to offer little
  Linux copyright I held to help the effort.

<p>Most importantly though, it is why I fully support Conservancy in
  <a href=http://sfconservancy.org/news/2015/mar/05/vmware-lawsuit/>taking
  legal action against VMware</a> which for years has been out of
  compliance with Linux’s license.

<p>If you care about free software, the GPL or want more projects like OpenWrt,
  <a href=http://sfconservancy.org/linux-compliance/vmware-lawsuit-appeal.html>consider
  donating</a> to help Christoph Hellwig and the Conservancy with
  their legal battle against this multi-billion-dollar corporation who
  for some reason decided to free-ride on other people’s work without
  respecting their wishes.

<p>If you can’t or don’t want to donate, twitting something along the lines of
‘<q>Play by the rules, @VMware. I defend the
<a href=https://twitter.com/hashtag/GPL>#GPL</a> with Christoph &amp;
<a href=https://twitter.com/conservancy>@Conservancy</a>. <a href=https://twitter.com/hashtag/DTRTvmware><abbr>#DTRT</abbr>vmware</a>
Help at https://sfconservancy.org/supporter/</q>’ or otherwise spreading the
word will help as well. Oh, and in case you were, like I was, wondering — DTRT
stands for ‘do the right thing’.

<p>And if you want to know more:
