<p>It has been a long time since my last entry.  In fact, it was so
long, that this condition has already been <a
href="http://zboczuch.jogger.pl/2010/10/20/moje-wpisy-sa-wieksze-od-twoich/">pointed
out</a> pushing me into finally writing something.  Inspired by <a
href=http://blogs.fsfe.org/adridg/?p=1014>Adriaan de
Groot’s entry</a>, I decided to write something about <tt>0</tt>,
<tt>NULL</tt> and upcoming <tt>nullptr</tt>.

<p>I will try to be informative and explain what the whole buzz is
about and then give my opinion about <tt>nullptr</tt>.  Let us first
inspect how a <a
href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(computing)#Null_pointer>null
pointer</a> can be donated in C and C++.

<!-- EXCERPT -->

<h3>The confusing <tt>0</tt></h3>

<p>In C and C++, the literal <tt>0</tt> has two meanings: it’s either
an octal (yes, octal) literal representing number zero or a null
pointer.  Which meaning is used depends on context, which compiler can
usually figure out.  For instance:

<pre><b>void</b> number(<b>int</b>);
<b>void</b> pointer(<b>char</b> *);

<b>int</b> main(<b>void</b>) {
	<b>char</b> ch, *ptr;
	ch = 0;		/* number zero (ch is of type char) */
	ptr = 0;	/* null pointer (ptr is of type pointer to char)*/
	number(0);	/* number zero (number accepts int as argument) */
	pointer(0);	/* null pointer (pointer accepts pointer to
			 * char as argument) */
	<b>return</b> 0;	/* number zero (main returns int) */
}</pre>

<p>However, if function lacks a prototype or has variable length of
arguments, there may be too little information to figure out what
programmer meant.  A good example is <tt>printf()</tt> function from
standard library:

<pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

<b>int</b> main(<b>void</b>) {
	printf("%p\n", 0);	/* ??? */
	<b>return</b> 0;
}</pre>

<p>In those situations, the first meaning is assumed but since it is
not so common nowadays it is not such a big issue.  Still there are
two things to keep in mind: (i) <em>always</em> provide function
prototypes and (ii) when using functions with variable arguments use
<tt>(<i>foo</i> *)0</tt> to mean a null pointer.


<h3>The confusing <tt>NULL</tt></h3>

<p>Since context is not always obvious some programmers prefer to
explicitly indicate the intended meaning by using different notations
for numbers and pointers.  For those purposes, <tt>NULL</tt> macro has
been introduced.  Standard requires that it is defined in such a way,
that it can be used in pointer context to mean a null pointer.  In C,
the macro is often defined as:

<pre>#define NULL ((void *)0)</pre>

<p>This guarantees not only that <tt>NULL</tt> means a null pointer in
pointer context but also that a diagnostic message must be issued when
one tries to use <tt>NULL</tt> as a number, ie.:

<pre>$ <i>cat test.c</i>
#include &lt;stddef.h&gt;

<b>int</b> main(<b>void</b>) {
	<b>return</b> NULL;
}
$ <i>gcc -ansi -pedantic test.c</i>
test.c: In function ‘main’:
test.c:4: warning: return makes integer from pointer without a cast
$</pre>

<p>But then comes C++ with stricter typing and says implicit
conversions from pointer to void to any other pointer type are
invalid, which renders the following an invalid C++ code:

<pre><b>int</b> main(<b>void</b>) {
	<b>char</b> *ptr = (<b>void</b> *)0;
	<b>return</b> 0;
}</pre>

<p>The easiest way around is to define <tt>NULL</tt> as plain
<tt>0</tt> or <tt>0L</tt>.  This is in fact what often happens.  GCC
uses <tt>__null</tt> extension but it seems <tt>__null</tt> is treated
like <tt>0L</tt> in some contexts:

<pre>$ <i>cat test.c</i>
#include &lt;stddef.h&gt;

<b>int</b> main(<b>void</b>) {
	<b>int</b> ret = NULL;	/* no complains */
	ret += <b>__null</b>;
	ret += NULL;
	<b>return</b> ret;
}
$ <i>g++  -ansi -pedantic test.c</i>
test.c: In function ‘int main()’:
test.c:5: warning: NULL used in arithmetic
test.c:6: warning: NULL used in arithmetic
$</pre>

<p>Whenever you use <tt>NULL</tt>, you have to keep in mind that you
never know what it really is.  This in particular means, that the
following code, after pre-processing, may or may not be valid:

<pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

<b>int</b> main(<b>void</b>) {
	printf("%p\n", NULL);	/* ((void *)0)? 0? 0L? __null? */
	<b>return</b> 0;
}</pre>


<h3>Function overloading</h3>

<p>And since we are in the realm of C++ we can now deal with the
biggest issue.  As you may already know, C++ allows function
overloading, so that several functions with the same name can exist so
long as they have different arguments.  As a consequence, function
name is not enough to figure out function’s prototype.  Let us
consider the following simple code:

<pre><b>void</b> print(<b>int</b> num);
<b>void</b> print(<b>void</b> *ptr);

<b>int</b> main(<b>void</b>) {
	print(0);
	<b>return</b> 0;
}</pre>

<p>The above will invoke the first function.  To call the second one,
we should use a cast, since we know that using <tt>NULL</tt> is not
reliable:

<pre><b>int</b> main(<b>void</b>) {
	print((<b>void</b> *)0);
	<b>return</b> 0;
}</pre>

<p>The lesson here is that in C++ you must always use
<tt>(<i>foo</i> *)0</tt> when you want to pass a null pointer to
a function.  Even if the call is not ambiguous at this time, someone
may add an overloaded version of the function which will break the
code if cast is not used in the first case.


<h3>Useless <tt>nullptr</tt></h3>

<p>Addressing those issues, the C++ working group defined a new
<tt>nullptr</tt> keyword which evaluates to a null pointer of type
<tt>std::nullptr_t</tt> which can be implicitly converted to any other
pointer while, at the same time, cannot be converted to a number.

<p>This seems like a good thing, right? Unfortunately, there are two
issues with this approach.  First one is that it does not fix the
problem.  For instance, the following is still ambiguous:

<pre><b>void</b> print(<b>char</b> *);
<b>void</b> foo(wchar_t *);

<b>int</b> main(<b>void</b>) {
	print(<b>nullptr</b>);
}</pre>

<p>At the same time, yet another keyword has been introduced which
serves no purpose.  <tt>NULL</tt> was a perfectly fine identifier
which might be used without polluting keyword name space (which is
a problem since adding a keyword to the language may break existing
code).

<p>My recommendation is not to bother with it.  Just ignore this thing
and stick to <tt>NULL</tt> where context is clear and
<tt>(<i>foo</i> *)0</tt> when calling function.

<p>UPDATE: It has been pointed out to me that <tt>nullptr</tt> in fact
fixes a single problem: it prevents an incorrect function from being
called.  This is true but it does not change much in my reasoning:
I still recommend ignoring <tt>nullptr</tt> and using <tt>NULL</tt>,
which is more portable and when <tt>nullptr</tt> comes around,
compilers will define the latter as the former anyway. This is also
what C++ committee should do instead of adding to the confusion by
introducing <em>yet another</em> method of representing a null
pointer.

<h3>Null pointer representation</h3>

<p>The last thing I want to talk about is a null pointer’s
representation.  There are two misconceptions that came from the fact
that <tt>0</tt> is used to mean a null pointer.  The first one is that
a null pointer is in fact represented by a “zero value” (ie. all bits
clear).  The second one is that when implementation uses a different
representation assigning <tt>0</tt> to a pointer does not yield a null
pointer.

<p>Both of those are incorrect.  In some implementations
(microcontrollers, x86 real mode, …) a “zero pointer” is perfectly
fine and using (for instance) all bits set representation to mean
a null pointer may make more sense.  At the same time, it’s compiler
responsibility to use correct representation whenever <tt>0</tt> is
used to mean a <tt>null pointer</tt>.

<p>UPDATE: Przemoc <a href=http://c-faq.com/null/machexamp.html>has
pointed to one of <tt>comp.lang.c</tt> FAQs</a> which gives examples
of machines where null pointers that are not represented by all bits
clear as well as machines with different representation of pointers of
different types (which I haven’t mentioned in this article). Also, the
recurring issue of not being able to comment has been fixed (hopefully
for good this time).

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>To sum things up, here are all the tips that you should keep in
mind while programming in C or C++:

<ol>
  <li>Always define function prototypes.  Always.
  <li>When function has variable number of arguments, use
  <tt>(<i>foo</i> *)0</tt> to mean a null pointer.
  <li>In C++, when specifying function arguments, use
  <tt>(<i>foo</i> *)0</tt> to mean a null pointer.  This also
  applies to a single argument constructors where no explicit
  function call is made.
  <li>When new C++ standard comes around, just ignore
  <tt>nullptr</tt>, it solves no problems and only adds to the
  confusion.
</ol>

<p>I usually do not compare against 0 or NULL.  I find it too verbouse, p and !p is just enqugh for me. :)</p>

<p>I never really felt the need to invent such a class even though it most probably will work as expected.  Actually my attitude towards NULL has changed recently: In the past I considered NULL too confusing and never used it (in favour of plain 0 or (foo *)0).  This had an advantage that whenever I wrote foo(0) I was fully aware that this may be interpreted as a number one day when a new overloaded version of foo() will come around.  Linux kernel hacking messed with my brain thought and I started using NULL. :P</p>

<p>In the end, however, anyone should use what works for them.  The above is a nice class indeed and if anyone feels like it, they should use it.</p>

<p>This also shows that compilers and the committee do something wrong.  Why on Earth, compilers don’t define NULL in terms of such an object?  This is really beyond me.  It would partially solve the problem (at least the part that nullptr tries to solve) without the need for standard to be changed at all.</p>
