<p>A few years back I bought
  <a href=http://www.bose.com/controller?url=/shop_online/headphones/noise_cancelling_headphones/quietcomfort_15/index.jsp>Bose
  QuietComfort 15 headphones</a>.  It was around the time I discovered
  just how noisy things can get at the altitude of around 10 km.
  QC15s turned out to be a life saver making an unbearable flights
  slightly more bearable.

<p>A few months ago I decided to risk substantial amount of money and
  got custom-made JH Audio
  <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-ear_monitor>in-ear monitors
  (or IEMs)</a>, <a href=http://www.jhaudio.com/content/jh13-pro>model
  JH13 Pro</a> — the risk was especially big since, for obvious reasons,
  they couldn't be resold.  Was it worth it?

<!-- EXCERPT -->

<h3>Noise and comfort</h3>

<p>My biggest worries were noise reduction and comfort.

<p>QCs use
  <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_noise_cancellation>active
  noise cancellation</a> to deliver
  <a href=http://www.innerfidelity.com/images/BoseQuietComfort15.pdf>isolation
  of up to 40 dB</a>.  Even though JH13s don't have such a feature, JH
  Audio still promises 26 dB noise reduction.  I've tested both on
  board of a metal can flying in the sky.  It wasn't rigorous, but it
  has shown IEMs were better at blocking sound of the engines than
  Bose headphones.  This should not be a surprise once one realises
  that according to
  <a href=http://www.innerfidelity.com/images/BoseQuietComfort15.pdf>InnerFidelity
  measurements</a> QC15s are a bit selective at which frequencies are
  isolated at the level of at least 25 dB.

<p>Regarding comfort, since all earphones I've ever used were low-end
  and relied on pressure imposed on the ear to stay inside of it,
  I was worried JHs would be uncomfortable to wear for long stretches
  of times.  Fortunately, because they are custom-made, they sit
  neatly inside the ear without incurring significant discomfort.
  Since I got them, I use them for several hours every day with no
  complains.

<p>This isn't to say that Bose headphones aren't comfortable — quite
  the opposite — but the IEMs have one advantage over QCs: they are
  much smaller.  This means they allow their wearer more freedom in
  positioning their head, occupy less space when transporting, and can
  neatly hang from underneath the shirt rather then uncomfortably
  wrapping the neck.


<h3>Sound quality</h3>

<p>As far as sound quality goes, I didn't notice significant
  differences.  This isn't to say that there are none.  Obviously,
  objectively speaking the monitors are better, but for someone
  without a good ear, the difference should be negligible.

<p>Another way to look at it is that audiophiles won't settle for
  anything less than
  <a href=http://www.jhaudio.com/content/sirens-roxanne>Roxanne</a>
  anyway.  And even though I may be exaggerating, the fact of the
  matter is that any number of reviews will say that if sound quality
  is a concerned, Bose is not the best option.


<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

<p>A minor advantage of JHs is that flight attendants often let me
  wear them during take-off and landing, while getting grumpy about
  full size headphones.  As a side note, it is interesting to notice
  people often assume I can hear them over my IEMs, which is rarely
  the case.  The confusion is of course quickly resolved once I notice
  their lips moving.

<p>And of course one cannot forget that QC15s require a battery to
  function. This is a minor annoyance, and it is enough to carry
  a handful of rechargeable batteries in the case the headphones come
  with, but I felt compelled to mention it.

<p>On the other hand, because they have higher impedance than JH
  IEMs, more low volumes are achievable on the former then the latter
  (if things like phones are used as the source).  This wouldn't be
  worth noting if it wasn't for the fact that the former deals with
  noise on the line better.  On one of my flights there was a constant
  high-frequency sound when I plugged my IEMs into the entertainment
  system, but with QCs I could get rid of it by increasing the volume
  and thus increasing signal-to-noise ratio.

<h3>Bottom line</h3>

<p>Ultimately it comes down to price.  I like my new JH13 IEMs better
  than my old QC15s and can safely recommend them to anyone with
  enough money, albeit 1100 USD is a lot of cash.

<p>Some alternatives include 400 USD
  <a href=http://www.jhaudio.com/product/jh5-pro-custom-ear-monitor>JH5
  Pro</a> IEMs or a 280
  USD <a href="http://www.bose.com/controller?url=/shop_online/headphones/noise_cancelling_headphones/quietcomfort_20/index.jsp&amp;Variant=qc20">QuietComfort
  20</a> in-ear headphones, which are actually cheaper than 300 USD QC
  15, smaller and thus easier to carry, and
  <a href=http://www.forbes.com/sites/geoffreymorrison/2013/08/18/bose-quietcomfort-20-review/>apparently
  better at cancelling noise</a>.

<p>How about wire in QC15s ? I am very gifted in destroying headphone wires. Are they durable and/or interchangeable easily ?</p>

<p>I had no problems with the wire and it survived several years. Furthermore, the wire is interchangeable so even if you do manage to break it, you can buy a new one. The same is true for JHs.</p>
