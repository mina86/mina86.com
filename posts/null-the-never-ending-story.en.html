<p>I have already mentioned <a href="/2010/0-is-ambiguous/">some
problems with the null pointer</a> but my recent discovery knocked my
socks off.</p>

<p>By now, it should come with no surprise to anyone that <code>0</code>
in pointer context acts as a null pointer (no matter of its
actual representation).  Moreover, it takes only a tiny bit of
experimenting to figure out that expressions like <code>(int)0</code> do
as well.  The latter is in itself a bit of a pita but it is
conforming to the C++ standard which says:</p>

<!-- EXCERPT -->

<blockquote>
  <p>4.10.1 A <dfn>null pointer constant</dfn> is an integral
  constant expression rvalue of integer type that evaluates to
  zero. […]</p>

  <p>5.19.1 […] An <dfn>integral constant-expression</dfn>
  can involve only literals, enumerators, const variables or static
  data members of integral or enumeration types initialized with
  constant expressions, non-type template parameters of integral or
  enumeration types, and <code>sizeof</code> expressions. […]</p>

  <p>3.9.1.7 Types <code>bool</code>, <code>char</code>,
  <code>wchar_t</code>, and the signed and unsigned integer types are
  collectively called <dfn>integral types</dfn>.  A synonym for
  integral type is <dfn>integer type</dfn>.  […]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, not only <code>(int)0</code> is a perfectly valid null pointer
constant, but so are <code>false</code>, <code>1 - 1</code>,
<code>sizeof(char) - sizeof(char)</code>, etc.  Not only that,
a const variable of type int with value of zero is also
a valid null pointer constant.</p>

<p>This is not limited to C++ by the way.  C has similar wording
even though it treats fewer things as a constant expression.  As
a matter of fact, in the upcoming C++ standard it will become
even worse as it adds more things to the definition of constant
expression.</p>

<p>Like I’ve said, this comes to me as a bit of surprise and
I have real trouble believing that it was C and C++ standard
committees.  Who could possibly want to represent a null pointer
in a different way than plain <code>0</code> (or <code>NULL</code> (or
<code>nullptr</code>)).</p>

<p>And now, a super important public service announcement: don’t feed
the yao guai.  Oh wait, wrong one.  Beware of dereferencing a pointer
cause you might assign null value to it instead of zeroing pointed to
object.</p>

<p>Thank you captain obvious!</p>

<p>On the other hand, most weird cases will give you a warning when using a real compiler with proper flags.</p>

<p>IMO those are far from obvious (ie. not everyone knows about it) and in fact counterintuitive.  Also, it seems gcc does not produce warnings which for me was troubling at best.</p>

<p>C and C++ do not have that much of dangerous implicit type conversions.  In fact, C++ ever removed a few as it disallows implicit conversion of a pointer to void to some other pointer, and enumeration type to integer type. This made me hope that “false” or “UINT_MAX + 1” are not valid null pointers.</p>
<p>In the worst case, I would at least expect GCC to issue a warning.</p>
<p>Guess it was not obvious only to me though.</p>
