<p>π is one of those constants which pops up when least expected.  At the same
  time it’s sometimes missing when most needed.  For example, consider the
  following application calculating area of a disk (not to be confused with area
  of a circle which is zero):

<pre>
#include &lt;math.h>
#include &lt;stdio.h>
#include &lt;stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
	for (int i = 1; i &lt; argc; ++i) {
		const double r = atof(argv[i]);
		printf("%f\n", M_PI * r * r);
	}
}
</pre>

<p>It uses features introduced in the 1999 edition of the C standard (often
  referred to as C99) so it might be good to inform the compiler of that fact
  with a <code>-std=c99</code> flag.  Unfortunately, doing so leads to an error:

<pre>
$ gcc -std=c99 -o area area.c
area.c: In function ‘main’:
area.c:8:18: error: ‘M_PI’ undeclared (first use in this function)
    8 |   printf("%f\n", M_PI * r * r);
      |                  ^~~~
</pre>

<p>What’s going on?  Shouldn’t <code>math.h</code> provide the definition
  of <code>M_PI</code> symbol?  It’s
  what <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/math.h.html">the
  specification</a> claims after all.  ‘glibc is broken’ some may even proclaim.
  In this article I’ll explain why the compiler conspire with the standard
  library to behave this way and why it’s the only valid thing it can do.

<h2>The problem</h2>

<p id=b1>First of all, it needs to be observed that the aforecited specification
  is <em>not</em> the C standard.  Instead, it’s POSIX and it
  marks <code>M_PI</code> with an [XSI] tag.  This means that <code>M_PI</code>
  ‘is part of the X/Open Systems Interfaces option’ and ‘is an extension to the
  ISO C standard.’
  Indeed, <a href="https://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1256.pdf">The
  C99 standard</a><sup><a href=#f1>1</a></sup> doesn’t define this constant.

<p>Trying to support multiple standards, gcc and glibc behave differently
  depending on arguments.  With <code>-std=c99</code> switch the compiler
  conforms to C standard; without the switch, it includes all the POSIX
  extensions.

<p>A naïve approach would be to make life easier and unconditionally provide the
  constant.  Alas, the <code>M_PI</code> identifier is neither defined nor
  reserved by the C standard.  In other words, programmer can freely use it and
  a conforming compiler cannot complain.  For example, the following is
  a well-formed C program and C compiler has no choice but to accept it:

<pre>
#include &lt;math.h>
#include &lt;stdio.h>
#include &lt;stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
	const double M_PI = 22.0 / 7.0;
	for (int i = 1; i &lt; argc; ++i) {
		const double r = atof(argv[i]);
		printf("%f\n", M_PI * r * r);
	}
}
</pre>

<p>Should compiler always define <code>M_PI</code> in <code>math.h</code> the
  above code wouldn’t work.


<h2>The solution</h2>

<p>The developer who needs π constant has a few ways to solve the problem.  For
  maximum portability it has to be defined in the program itself.  To make
  things work even when building on a Unix-like system, an <code>ifdef</code>
  guard can be used.  For example:

<pre>
⋮
#ifndef M_PI
#  define M_PI  3.141592653589793238462643383279502884
#endif
⋮
</pre>

<p>Another solution is to limit compatibility to Unix-like systems.  In this
  case, <code>M_PI</code> constant can be freely used and <code>-std</code>
  switch shouldn’t be passed when building the program.


<h3>Feature test macros</h3>

<p>glibc provides one more approach.  The C standard has a notion of reserved
  identifiers which cannot be freely used by programmers.  They are used for
  future language development and to allow implementations to provide their own
  extensions to the language.

<p>For example, when C99 added boolean type to the language, it did it by
  defining a <code>_Bool</code> type.  A <code>bool</code>, <code>true</code>
  and <code>false</code> symbols became available only through
  a <code>stdbool.h</code> file.  Such approach means that C89 code continues to
  work when built with C99 compiler even if it
  used <code>bool</code>, <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> identifiers in
  its own way.

<p>Similarly, glibc introduced <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/590381">feature
  test macros</a>.  They all start with an underscore followed by a capital
  letter.  Identifiers in this form are reserved by the C standard thus using
  them in a program invokes undefined behaviour.  Technically speaking, the
  following is not a well-formed C program:

<pre>
#define _XOPEN_SOURCE

#include &lt;math.h>
#include &lt;stdio.h>
#include &lt;stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
	for (int i = 1; i &lt; argc; ++i) {
		const double r = atof(argv[i]);
		printf("%f\n", M_PI * r * r);
	}
}
</pre>

<p>However,
  glibc <a href="https://gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Feature-Test-Macros.html">documents
    the behaviour</a> making the program well-defined.

<p>It’s worth noting that uClibc and musl libraries handle the cases in much the
  same way.  Microsoft uses the same technique though different macros. To get
  access to <code>M_PI</code> in particular, a <code>_USE_MATH_DEFINES</code>
  symbol needs to be defined.  Newlib will define symbols conflicting with
  C standard unless code is compiled in strict mode
  (e.g. with <code>-std=c99</code> flag).  Lastly, Bionic and Diet Libc define
  the constant unconditionally which strictly speaking means that they don’t
  conform to the C standard.


<p id=f1><a href=#b1>1</a> Yes, I’m aware this link is to a draft.  The actual
  standard
  is <a href="https://webstore.ansi.org/Standards/INCITS/INCITSISOIEC98991999R2005">60
  USD from ANSI webstore</a>.  Meanwhile, for most practical uses the draft is
  entirely sufficient.  It’s certainly enough for the discussion in this
  article.
