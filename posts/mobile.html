<p>A few days ago I received an email from Google Wembaster Tools saying no more no less but: ‘Your webpage sucks on mobile devices!’ Or something. Now that I think of it, I could have been worded slightly differently. The gist was the same though.

<p>I never really paid that much attention to how my site
  looks on phones and tables.  I’ve made sure it loaded and looked, but
  apart from that never spent much time on the issue.  I always
  thought optimising for a small screen would be a lengthy and painful process.
  How mistaken I was!

<p>In my defence, when I last looked at the problem, state of mobile
  browsers was different; now there are really just two things to
  do.  First of all, add a <code>viewport</code> meta tag, e.g.:

<pre>
&lt;meta name=viewport
      content="width=<i>device-width</i>, initial-scale=1"&gt;</pre>

<p>and then <a href=https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/>use <code>min-width</code> or <code>max-width</code> CSS media
  queries</a>.  Admittedly the second part may take some time, but if
  your layout uses simple markup rather than being TABLE-based,
  reading the excellent article on A List Apart might turn out to be
  the most time consuming step.

<p>If you haven’t already, do take a look at whether your website
  looks reasonably well on small screens.  Apparently mobile is the
  future, or some such.

<p>The ‘bad’ news is that I’ve dropped endless scroll feature.  This is
  because in narrow layout the sidebar moves to the bottom and
  endless scrolling would make it unreachable since it would
  run away all the time.
