<p>Solana transactions
  are <a href="https://solana.com/docs/core/transactions">limited to 1232
  bytes</a>.  While adequate for simple programs, the size limit was too
  restrictive when I was implementing
  Solana <a href="https://ibcprotocol.dev/">IBC</a> bridge while working
  at <a href="/2024/beware-composable-foundation/">Composable Foundation</a>.
  I needed the bridge smart contract to be able to ingest
  signed <a href="https://tendermint.com/">Tendermint</a> block headers which
  were a few kilobytes in size.

<p>To overcome this obstacle, I’ve used what I came to call <dfn>chunking</dfn>.
  By sending the instruction data in multiple transactions (similarly to the
  way <a href="https://solana.com/docs/programs/deploying#program-buffer-accounts">Solana
  programs are deployed</a>), the Solana IBC smart contract is capable of
  working on arbitrarily-large instructions.  This article describes how this
  process works and how to incorporate it with other smart contracts (including
  those using the Anchor framework).

<p>This article assumes familiarity with Solana; it’s not a step-by-step guide
  on creating Solana programs.  Nevertheless, code samples are
  from <a href="https://github.com/mina86/solana-write-account/tree/master/examples">examples
  available in the <code>solana-write-account</code> repository</a>
  (a <code>chsum-program</code> Solana program and <code>chsum-client</code>
  command line tool used to invoke said program) which can be used as a starting
  point when incorporating the chunking method described below.


<h2>Demonstration of the problem</h2>

<p>First let’s reproduce the described issue.  Consider the following (somewhat
  contrived) <code>chsum</code> Solana program which computes a simple
  parameterised checksum.  When called, the first byte of its instruction data
  is the checksum parameter and the rest is the data to calculate the checksum
  of.

<pre>
solana_program::entrypoint!(process_instruction);

fn process_instruction&lt;'a&gt;(
    _program_id: &amp;'a Pubkey,
    _accounts: &amp;'a [AccountInfo],
    instruction: &amp;'a [u8],
) -&gt; Result&lt;(), ProgramError&gt; {
    let (mult, data) = instruction
        .split_first()
        .ok_or(ProgramError::InvalidInstructionData)?;
    let sum = data.chunks(2).map(|pair| {
        u64::from(pair[0]) * u64::from(*mult) +
            pair.get(1).copied().map_or(0, u64::from)
    }).fold(0, u64::wrapping_add);
    solana_program::msg!("{}", sum);
    Ok(())
}
</pre>

<p>The program works on data of arbitrary length which can be easily observed by
  executing it with progressively longer buffers.  However, due to
  aforementioned transaction size limit, eventually the operation fails:

<pre style="white-space:pre-wrap">
$ <b>chsum-client 2 ab</b>
Program log: 292

$ <b>chsum-client 2 abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz</b>
Program log: 4264

$ <b>data=<i>…</i></b>
$ <b>echo "${#data}"</b>
1062
$ <b>chsum-client 2 "$data"</b>
RPC response error -32602: decoded solana_sdk::<wbr>transaction::<wbr>versioned::<wbr>VersionedTransaction too large: 1233 bytes (max: 1232 bytes)
</pre>


<h2 id=write-account>The <code>write-account</code> program</h2>

<p>To solve the problem, the overlarge instruction can be split into
  smaller <dfn>chunks</dfn> which can be sent to the blockchain in separate
  transactions and stored inside of a Solana account.  For this to work two
  things are needed: i) a smart contract which can receive and concatenate all
  those chunks; and ii) support in the target smart contract for reading
  instruction data from an account (rather than from transaction’s payload).

<p>The first requirement is addressed
  by <a href="https://github.com/mina86/solana-write-account">the <code>write-account</code>
  program</a>.  It copies bytes from its instruction data into a given account
  at specified offset.  Subsequent calls allow arbitrary (and most importantly
  arbitrarily-long) data to be written into the account.


<h2>RPC Client</h2>

<p>The simplest way to send the chunks to the smart contract is to use client
  library functions packaged alongside the <code>write-account</code> program.
  First, add a new dependency to the RPC client:

<pre>
[dependencies.solana-write-account]
git = "https://github.com/mina86/solana-write-account"
features = ["client"]
</pre>

<p>And with that, the <code>WriteIter</code> can be used to split overlong
  instruction data into chunks and create all the necessary instructions.  By
  default the <code>data</code> is length-prefixed when it’s written to the
  account.  This simplifies reuse of the account since the length of written
  data can be decoded without a need to resize the account.

<pre>
// <i>Write chunks to a new account</i>
let (chunks, write_account, write_account_bump) =
    solana_write_account::instruction::WriteIter::new(
        &amp;WRITE_ACCOUNT_PROGRAM_ID,
        signer.pubkey(),
        WRITE_ACCOUNT_SEED,
        data,
    )?;
// <i><strong>Note</strong>: All of those instructions can be executed in parallel.</i>
for inst in chunks {
    send_and_confirm_instruction(client, signer, inst)?;
}

// <i>Invoke the target smart contract. </i>write_account<i> is the</i>
// <i>account with the instruction data.  It will need to be</i>
// <i> passed to the smart contract as last account.</i>
todo!("Invoke the target smart contract");

// <i>Optionally, free the account to recover deposit</i>
let inst = solana_write_account::instruction::free(
    WRITE_ACCOUNT_PROGRAM_ID,
    signer.pubkey(),
    Some(write_account),
    WRITE_ACCOUNT_SEED,
    write_account_bump,
)?;
send_and_confirm_instruction(client, signer, inst)?;
</pre>

<p>The data is copied into <a href="https://solana.com/docs/core/pda">a Program
  Derived Address (PDA) account</a> owned by the <code>write-account</code>
  program.  The smart contract makes sure that different signers get their own
  accounts so that they won’t override each other’s work.
  <code>WRITE_ACCOUNT_SEED</code> allows a single signer to maintain multiple
  accounts if necessary.

<p>The address of the account holding the instruction data is saved in
  the <code>write_account</code> variable.  But before it can be passed to the
  target smart contract, the smart contract needs to be altered to support such
  calling convention.


<h2>The target smart contract</h2>

<p>The Solana runtime has no built-in mechanism for passing instruction data
  from an account.  Smart contract needs to explicitly support such calling
  method.  One approach is to always read data from an account.  This may be
  appropriate if the smart contract usually deals with overlong payloads.
  A more flexible approach is to read instruction from the account if
  instruction data in the transaction is empty.  This can be done by defining
  a custom entry point:

<pre>
/// Solana smart contract entry point.
///
/// If the instruction data is empty, reads length-prefixed data
/// from the last account and treats it as the instruction data.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// Must be called with pointer to properly serialised
/// instruction such as done by the Solana runtime.  See
/// [`solana_program::entrypoint::deserialize`].
#[no_mangle]
pub unsafe extern "C" fn entrypoint(input: *mut u8) -&gt; u64 {
    // SAFETY: Guaranteed by the caller.
    let (prog_id, mut accounts, mut instruction_data) = unsafe {
        solana_program::entrypoint::deserialize(input)
    };

    // If instruction data is empty, the actual instruction data
    // comes from the last account passed in the call.
    if instruction_data.is_empty() {
        match get_ix_data(&amp;mut accounts) {
            Ok(data) =&gt; instruction_data = data,
            Err(err) =&gt; return err.into(),
        }
    }

    // Process the instruction.
    process_instruction(
        prog_id,
        &amp;accounts,
        instruction_data,
    ).map_or_else(
        |error| error.into(),
        |()| solana_program::entrypoint::SUCCESS
    )
}

/// Interprets data in the last account as instruction data.
fn get_ix_data&lt;'a&gt;(
    accounts: &amp;mut Vec&lt;AccountInfo&lt;'a&gt;&gt;,
) -&gt; Result&lt;&amp;'a [u8], ProgramError&gt; {
    let account = accounts.pop()
        .ok_or(ProgramError::NotEnoughAccountKeys)?;
    let data = alloc::rc::Rc::try_unwrap(account.data)
        .ok().unwrap().into_inner();
    if data.len() &lt; 4 {
        return Err(ProgramError::InvalidInstructionData);
    }
    let (len, data) = data.split_at(4);
        .ok_or(ProgramError::InvalidInstructionData)?;
    let len = u32::from_le_bytes(len.try_into().unwrap());
    data.get(..(len as usize))
        .ok_or(ProgramError::InvalidInstructionData)
}

solana_program::custom_heap_default!();
solana_program::custom_panic_default!();
</pre>

<p>The <code>solana-write-account</code> crate packages all of that code.
  Rather than copying the above, a smart contract wanting to accept instruction
  data from an account can add the necessary dependency (this time with
  the <code>lib</code> Cargo feature enabled):

<pre>
[dependencies.solana-write-account]
git = "https://github.com/mina86/solana-write-account"
features = ["lib"]
</pre>

<p>and use <code>entrypoint</code> macro defined there (in place
of <code>solana_program::entrypoint</code> macro):

<pre>
solana_write_account::entrypoint!(process_instruction);
</pre>


<h2>Anchor framework</h2>

<p>This gets slightly more complicated for anyone
  using <a href="https://www.anchor-lang.com/">the Anchor framework</a>.  The
  framework provides abstractions which are hard to break through when
  necessary.  Any Anchor program has to use
  the <code>anchor_lang::program</code> macro which, among other things, defines
  the <code>entrypoint</code> function.  This leads to conflicts when a smart
  contract wants to define its own entry point.

<p>Unfortunately, there’s no reliable way to tell Anchor not to introduce that
  function.  To add <code>write-account</code> support to the Solana IBC bridge
  I had
  to <a href="https://github.com/mina86/anchor/tree/custom-entrypoint">fork
  Anchor</a> and extend it with the
  following <a href="https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor/commit/788c61c2d72aad374457d7619d8fe37d6ac2c0e9">change</a>
  which introduces support for a new <code>custom-entrypoint</code> Cargo
  feature:

<pre>
diff --git a/lang/syn/src/codegen/program/entry.rs b/lang/syn/src/codegen/program/entry.rs
index 4b04da23..093b1813 100644

         Err(anchor_lang::error::ErrorCode::InstructionMissing.into())
     });
     quote! {
-        #[cfg(not(feature = "no-entrypoint"))]
+        #[cfg(not(any(feature = "no-entrypoint", feature = "custom-entrypoint")))]
         anchor_lang::solana_program::entrypoint!(entry);
         /// The Anchor codegen exposes a programming model where a user defines
         /// a set of methods inside of a `#[program]` module in a way similar
</pre>

<p>The feature needs to be enabled in the <code>Cargo.toml</code> of the Anchor
  program which wants to take advantage of it:

<pre>
[features]
default = ["custom-entrypoint"]
custom-entrypoint = []
</pre>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>To achieve a sub-second finality Solana had to introduce significant
  constraints on the protocol and smart contract runtime environment.  However,
  with enough ingenuity at least some of those can be worked around.

<p>This article introduced a way to overcome the 1232-byte transaction size
  limit through the use of a <code>write-account</code> helper program and
  library functions which are available
  in <a href="https://github.com/mina86/solana-write-account"><code>solana-write-account</code>
  repository</a>.

<p>The solution is general enough that any Solana program, including those using
  Anchor framework, can use it.
