<p>This is a public service announcement to inform you, if you are not
yet aware,
that <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/consultations/2013/copyright-rules/index_en.htm">European
Union is asking for input on the review of copyright rules</a>. The
deadline for submission of the questionnaire is 5th of February so if
you want to give your opinion you should hurry.

<p>Answering 80 questions may not be your idea of fun.  Fortunately
you don’t have to answer all of the questions plus to makes matter
easier you can use a simplified web-form
at <a href="http://copywrongs.eu">copywrongs.eu</a> or
read <a href="https://ameliaandersdotter.eu/copyright-consultation-model-responses">a simple
guide</a> by Amelia Andersdotter, a Swedish Pirate Party politician
and Member of the European Parliament.
