<p>Some regular visitors of the web site may be aware that the page
  used to run on Jogger.pl platform.  Some will also be aware
  that <a href="http://blog.jogger.pl/2016/02/20/13-lat-jogger-pl-i-jego-zamkniecie/">the
  service closes shop</a>, an act which forced me to move to another
  hosting.

<p>In moving the page, I’ve tried to keep old URLs work so even though
  canonical locations for posts have changed, the old links should
  result in a correct redirect.

<p>This is also true for feeds <em>but</em> while Jogger provided
  customisation options (RSS and Atom, excerpts only, no HTML and
  posts count), currently only full-content HTML Atom feeds limited to
  newest ten entries are provided.

<p><strong>If anything broke for you, please do let me know at
    <a href="mailto:mina86@mina86.com">mina86@mina86.com</a>.</strong>

<p>I have not yet figured out what to do with comments which is why
  commenting is currently unavailable.  Since I want my whole page to
  be completely static, I’m planning on using a third-party widget.
  So far I’ve narrowed the choice down to
  <a href=https://www.htmlcommentbox.com/ rel=nofollow>HTML Comment
  Box</a> and the new hotness, <a href=https://www.spot.im/
  rel=nofollow>Spot.IM</a>.  Any suggestions are also welcome.</p>

<p>On the bright side, the page now loads five times faster!
  Jogger.pl took its sweet time when generating responses.  A static
  page and better optimised infrastructure of my current provider
  allows to drop response time from 300 to 60 ms.
