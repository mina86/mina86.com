<p>Have you ever wondered why Caps Lock, a key you press twice
a decade (once to turn it on and then to turn it off), is in such
a lucrative position on the keyboard? And how about Ctrl?
Compared to Caps Lock it seems like miles away.  If you think about it
old unix keyboards with those keys swapped seem to got it right.</p>

<p>I’ve gone one step further and recommend turning Caps Lock into
Ctrl key altogether.  In this article I will describe how to
do that in various systems and platforms.  But lets start with some
propaganda.</p>

<!-- EXCERPT -->

<h2>Why bother?</h2>

<p>First of all, if you don’t use Caps Lock at all why waste space on
the keyboard?  Honestly!  Personally I don’t even remember when I used
Caps Lock last time – have I ever used it at all?  If you feel the
same way you should definitely go for it! Caps Lock+s is way easier to
press then Ctrl+s and that’s a key binding often used on various
systems.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, you do use Caps Lock you need to analyse how
often – if rarely I still say go for it!  Requirement to press Shift
a little more is minor annoyance compared to benefits which came from
not having to stretch your little finger so much.</p>

<p>But, if you use Caps Lock all the time, then still – go for it and
stop SCREAMING on IRC and in mails so much! No, honestly – flame wars
are not good for you health.</p>

<p>I’ve basically forced this settings on one of my colleagues at work
(he asked me for help and I kept toggling Caps Lock when
I wanted to press Ctrl so I’ve made the change) who was not
pleased at first but then seemed to like it.</p>


<h3>Swap?</h3>

<p>If you made a decision to give it a try you’ll probably wondering
that swapping Caps Lock and left Ctrl is better idea then using both
those key as Ctrl.  But I say no!</p>

<p>Caps Lock is so rarely used that whenever it is it wasts space and
I find some of the key shortcuts to be typed easier with lower left
Ctrl (but that may be only a habit) – in particular all the
Ctrl+Shift+whatever bindings.</p>

<p>Moreover, old habits die hard and so you’d make too many mistakes
if you’d place Caps Lock where you’re used to have Ctrl.</p>


<h3>Other Systems</h3>

<p>Usually, with modifications like that an argument of other people’s
computers comes in mind – what if I have to do something on some
machine without those modifications?</p>

<p>This is a perfectly valid argument but you need to ask
yourself how often do you work on computers you don’t own or have
control over configuration of?  In my case it’s a small fraction
of a per cent so I decided not to bother.</p>

<p>Of course, even if you are going to spend significant amount of
time on other people’s computers you can still consider the change –
it’s up to you.</p>



<h2>X-Window</h2>

<p>Lets start with widely used in *nix word X-Window system.  First of
all, if you are using KDE or Gnome you might try looking into
keyboard’s configuration applets of those desktops – there may be an
option to configure modifiers map.</p>

<p>Should you not find an option you’ll have to change some files by
hand.  As mentioned above I advocate using Caps Lock as another Ctrl
and so examples will feature <code>ctrl:nocaps</code> option – if you’d
rather swap the two keys use <code>ctrl:swapcaps</code> instead.  You can
of course specify several options if you have some already by
separating them with colons.</p>


<h3>Xkb, Debian &amp; Debian-based (like Ubuntu)</h3>

<p>If you are using Debian or Debian-based Linux distribution (such as
Ubuntu) and you are lucky all you need to do is to edit
<code>/etc/default/console-setup</code> file.  It has a line that
says</p>

<pre>XKBOPTIONS=""</pre>

<p>First modify it to:</p>

<pre>XKBOPTIONS="ctrl:nocaps"</pre>

<p>and then force dpkg to integrate your configuration by
invoking as root:</p>

<pre>dpkg-reconfigure console-setup</pre>

<p>I’ve been told it should work (ie. that’s what console-setup package is for) but if it does not for you (didn’t for me) just move to the next section.</p>

<h3>XKb, Configuration file</h3>

<p>If you’re not on Debian-based distribution or the above method
failed you might try fidling with X11 configuration.</p>

<p>First of, check if your system contains
<code>/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d</code> and <code>/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d</code>
directories (this is the case with Slackware starting with
version 13.37).  If it does, the former will most likely contain
a file with “keyboard” or “layout” in its name such as
<code>90-keyboard-layout.conf</code>.  If it does all you need to do is
copy it to the latter directory:</p>

<pre>
cp -i \
	/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/90-keyboard-layout.conf \
	/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/</pre>

<p>Once the file is copied, either add or modify the “XkbOptions”
option by adding “ctrl:nocaps”.  For instance, the file could look
something like this:</p>

<pre>
Section "InputClass"
	Identifier "keyboard-all"
	MatchIsKeyboard "on"
	MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"
	Driver "evdev"
	Option "XkbLayout" "us"
	#Option "XkbVariant" ""
	Option "XkbOptions" "terminate:ctrl_alt_bksp<b>,ctrl:nocaps</b>"
EndSection</pre>

<p>If this does not work or the files are missing, you may need to
edit X configuration file located at<code>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</code> or
<code>/etc/X11/XF86Config</code> on older systems.  Like before, if there’s an
<i>InputDevice</i> section for your keyboard it’s enough to add/modify
the “XkbOptions” option.</p>

<h3>Xkb, HAL</h3>

<p>It may happen that there is no <i>InputDevice</i> section for your
keyboard – that’s actually all right.  Newer versions of XOrg may use
HAL to determine available input devices in which case you need to
instruct it to pass proper options.  First find proper policy file
somewhere in <code>/etc/hal/policy</code> directory (under Slackware it’s
<code>10-keymap.fdi</code>).  Inside change <code>merge</code> element with
<i>input.xkb.options</i> key by adding <code>ctrl:nocaps</code> to the
value.  For instance here’s my file:</p>

<pre>
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;ISO-8859-1&quot;?&gt;
&lt;deviceinfo version=&quot;0.2&quot;&gt;
  &lt;device&gt;
    &lt;match key=&quot;info.capabilities&quot; contains=&quot;input.keymap&quot;&gt;
      &lt;append key=&quot;info.callouts.add&quot; type=&quot;strlist&quot;&gt;hal-setup-keymap&lt;/append&gt;
    &lt;/match&gt;

    &lt;match key=&quot;info.capabilities&quot; contains=&quot;input.keys&quot;&gt;
      &lt;merge key=&quot;input.xkb.rules&quot; type=&quot;string&quot;&gt;&lt;/merge&gt;
      &lt;merge key=&quot;input.xkb.model&quot; type=&quot;string&quot;&gt;evdev&lt;/merge&gt;
      &lt;merge key=&quot;input.xkb.layout&quot; type=&quot;string&quot;&gt;pl,pl,pl&lt;/merge&gt;
      &lt;merge key=&quot;input.xkb.variant&quot; type=&quot;string&quot;&gt;,dvorak,dvp&lt;/merge&gt;
      &lt;merge key=&quot;input.xkb.options&quot; type=&quot;string&quot;&gt;ctrl:nocaps,terminate:ctrl_alt_bksp&lt;/merge&gt;

    &lt;/match&gt;
  &lt;/device&gt;
&lt;/deviceinfo&gt;</pre>


<h3>xmodmap</h3>

<p>If all of that fails or you don’t have super user privileges
you may need to use xmodmap.  Usually it’ll be enough to create
a <code>.Xmodmap</code> file in your home directory with the
following content:</p>

<pre>
remove Lock = Caps_Lock
add Control = Caps_Lock</pre>

<p>And to further turn left Ctrl to Caps Lock:</p>

<pre>
remove Control = Control_L
add Lock = Control_L</pre>

<p>To test if the file works simply invoke <code>xmodmap
~/.Xmodmap</code>.  If you got your desired effect then everything
should work next time you restart X session.  If <code>~/.Xmodmap</code>
does not get applied automatically you should consult your
distribution’s documentation – it’s possible you’ll need to edit (or
even creat) an <code>~/.xinit</code> file (you might <a
href="https://github.com/mina86/dot-files/blob/master/xinitrc">take
a look at mine</a> if you want).</p>




<h2>Unix Console</h2>

<p>If you never use console or use it to merely log in and invoke
<code>startx</code> you may skip this section but otherwise read on.
First of all, however, I must admit that even thought I’m
reffering to "Unix Console" I’m not sure if what I’m going to
write here is going to work for all kinds of *nix systems.</p>

<p>To avoid confusion I need to make it clear that console (or virtual
terminal or vtt) is not what you get in graphical interface
(<code><i>?</i>term</code>, <code>konsole</code>, <code>gnome-terminal</code>,
etc.).  On some GNU/Linux distributions users may not even see it –
a funky bootsplash can hide it pretty well.  If you don’t know what it
is just skip this section – you probably don’t need that
knowledge.</p>


<h3>Debian &amp; Debian-based (like Ubuntu)</h3>

<p>According to <a
href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MovingTheCtrlKey">Moving the Ctrl
Key</a> under Debian and Debian based distributions it’s enough to add
the following line to <code>/etc/console-tools/remap</code>:</p>

<pre>s/keycode[[:space:]][[:space:]]*58[[:space:]][[:space:]]*=[[:space:]][[:space:]]*Caps_Lock/keycode  58 = Control/</pre>

<p>and make it effective by invoking:</p>

<pre>sudo invoke-rc.d console-screen.sh restart</pre>

<p>If you also want to have Caps Lock under Ctrl add the following
line as well:</p>

<pre>s/keycode[[:space:]][[:space:]]*29[[:space:]][[:space:]]*=[[:space:]][[:space:]]*Control/keycode  29 = Caps_Lock/</pre>


<h3 id="us_layout">US Layout</h3>

<p>If you are using an US layout you might give <code>emacs</code> or
<code>emacs2</code> layouts a try.  Personally I’ve never tried those
but they may be what makes the trick for you.</p>

<p>To test them invoke <code>loadkeys emacs</code> or <code>loadkeys
emacs2</code> command in the console.  If either of the two is what you
want configure your system to use it by default.</p>

<p>Under Slackware you need to edit <code>/etc/rc.d/rc.keymap</code> file.
Under Gentoo try <code>/etc/conf.d/keymaps</code>.  On other systems –
sorry, your on your own but it shouldn’t be hard.</p>


<h3>setkeycodes</h3>

<p>If all of the above fails, you have a non-USB kayboard and you
need a quick and dirty solution try <code>setkeycodes 0x3a 29</code>
(plus <code>setkeycodes 0x1d 58</code> if you want to swap).</p>

<p>If it does not work try to verify the numbers.  To do that run
<code>showkey</code> command in the console.  Pressing Caps Lock and
Ctrl will give you their keycodes (58 and 29).  Then invoke
<code>showkey -s</code>.  Now you’ll be given scancodes (0x3a and 0x1d).
If the numbers were different change the <code>setkeycodes</code> command
accordingly.</p>

<p>If you have found command which works for you it’ll be enough to
put that somewhere in start scripts.  Under Slackware logical choice
would be the end of <code>/etc/rc.d/rc.keymap</code> file.  Other systems
usually have a “local” start script which one can edit – try
<code>/etc/rc.d/rc.local</code> or <code>/etc/rc.local</code> (you should
refer to distribution’s documentation).</p>


<h3>Keymap</h3>

<p>If the above method fails or you prefer a “cleaner” solution you
will need to edit your keymap.  First consult <code>loadkeys</code> man
page to find you where keymaps are saved on your systems
(<code>/usr/share/kbd/keymaps</code>, <code>/usr/share/keymaps</code> and
<code>/use/lib/kbd/keymaps</code> are usual choices).  Inside you’re find
directories for various architectures in which there are directories
for keyboard types and finally there are <code>.map.gz</code> files
describing keymap.  For instance, I use
<code>/usr/share/kbd/keymaps/i386/qwerty/pl2.map.gz</code> keymap.</p>

<p>After you have located your keymap all you have to do is:</p>

<pre>
cd /path/to/keymap/directory  # eg. cd /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/i386/qwerty
gzip -d &lt;<i>kaymap</i>.map.gz | \
sed \
	-e 's/keycode[[:space:]][[:space:]]*58[[:space:]][[:space:]]*=[[:space:]][[:space:]]*Caps_Lock/keycode  58 = Control' \
	-e 's/keycode[[:space:]][[:space:]]*29[[:space:]][[:space:]]*=[[:space:]][[:space:]]*Control/keycode  29 = Caps_Lock/' \
	| \
gzip -9 &gt;<i>kaymap</i>-my.map.gz</pre>

<p>You can use a bit more descriptive suffix instead of <code>-my</code> –
for instance <code>-nocaps</code> or <code>-swapcaps</code>.  Also this will
swap the Caps Lock and Ctrl key – if you’d rather use two Ctrls skip
the second <code>-e</code> line.</p>

<p>If you can’t seem to find proper map file invoke <code>dumpkeys</code>
instead of <code>gzip -d &lt;<i>kaymap</i>.map.gz</code> in the above
command.</p>

<p>After you’ve created your new keymap test it with <code>loadkeys
<i>keymap</i>-my</code> command.  If that’s what you want instruct your
system to use it permanently – refer to <a href="#us_layout">US
layout</a> section.</p>


<h3>NetBSD console</h3>

<p>All of the above methods were tested on various Linuxes so
I don’t know if they’ll work on other *nix systems.  However,
I found out that under NetBSD creating
a <code>/usr/share/wscons/keymaps/pckbd.c2c</code> file with
a single <code>keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L</code> entry and adding
<code>mapfile /usr/share/wscons/keymaps/pckbd.c2c</code> to
<code>/etc/wscons.conf</code> should do the trick.</p>


<h3>Man Pages</h3>

X applications mentioned try man pages:</p>

<h2>MS Windows</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, the world is not all Unix but even Microsoft Windows
users can help their little finger.</p>


<h3>Windows NT, Scancode Map</h3>

<p>Under Windows NT an entry in the registry should suffice.  Simply
create or download certain .reg file, apply it by double clicking and
finally restart the system for changes to take effect.</p>

<p>The files are <a
href="https://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/emacs/windows/docs/ntemacs/contrib/caps-as-ctrl.reg">caps-as-ctrl.reg</a>:</p>

<pre>
REGEDIT4

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout]
"Scancode Map"=hex:00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,02,00,00,00,1d,00,3a,00,00,00,00,00</pre>

<p>and <a href="https://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/emacs/windows/docs/ntemacs/contrib/caps-ctrl-swap.reg">caps-ctrl-swap.reg</a>:</p>

<pre>
REGEDIT4

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout]
"Scancode Map"=hex:00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,03,00,00,00,1d,00,3a,00,3a,00,1d,00,00,00,00,00</pre>

<p>Travis Krumsick created a tool called <a
href="http://webpages.charter.net/krumsick/">KeyTweak</a> which may
help you create your own <i>Scancode Map</i> entry.  There’s also an
archived <a
href="https://www.microsoft.com/whdc/archive/w2kscan-map.mspx">Scan
Code Mapper</a> article at <a
href="https://www.microsoft.com/">microsoft.com</a> which describes how
<i>Scancode Map</i> works in case you are interested.</p>



<h3>Ctrl2Cap</h3>

<p>On Windows NT you may also give <a
href="http://doc.sch130.nsc.ru/www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/source/ctrl2cap.shtml">Ctrl2Cap</a>
(<a
href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897578.aspx">mirror</a>)
utility a try.  Unzip <a
href="http://doc.sch130.nsc.ru/www.sysinternals.com/files/ctrl2cap.zip">it</a>
  and run <code>ctrl2cap /install</code> to install the driver.</p>

<p>There’s also <a
href="http://doc.sch130.nsc.ru/www.sysinternals.com/win9x/utilities/ctrl2cap95.shtml">Ctrl2Cap95</a>
for Windows 9x/Me.  Installation is a bit more difficult but
still easy.  Again unzip <a
href="http://doc.sch130.nsc.ru/www.sysinternals.com/files/c2cap95.zip">it</a>
and add the following line in the <code>[386enh]</code> section of
<code>System.ini</code> file:</p>

<pre>device=&lt;path&gt;\ctrl2cap.vxd</pre>

<p>where &lt;path&gt; represents the directory where you have placed
Ctrl2Cap.</p>




<h2>MacOS X</h2>

<p>If you happen to use MacOS X and want to configure your Caps
Lock key you shall go to <i>Keyboard &amp; Mouse</i> panel in
<i>System Preferences</i>.  When there, select <i>Keyboard</i> tab and
press <i>Modifier Keys</i> and make desired changes.</p>

<p>There’s also a <a
href="http://gnufoo.org/ucontrol/">uControl</a> tool which lets you
make the changes.</p>



<h2>What else?</h2>

<p>Using Caps Lock as another Ctrl key is not the only thing you can
do.  <a href="https://colemak.com/">Colemak</a>’s authors decided it’s
better used as another Backspace.  Personally I use Ctrl+H
instead of Backspace so I prefer having Ctrl there.</p>

<p>I’ve heard Vim users like to use Caps Lock as another Escape but
since Escape is the same as Ctrl+[ again maybe having another Control
there is better?</p>

<p>With a little research and modifications you can, of course,
use Caps Lock as anything you like.  In my opinion, thought, what
everyone should realise is that Caps Lock is useless and at the same
time occupy a very nice and easy-to-reach position on the
keyboard so why waste space?</p>

<p>I’ve switched ctrl+caps about two years ago, and can’t live with that.<br />
Under Xorg I’m using xmodmap, under Vista I’m using described registry-based solution</p>

<p>Your solution for Debian/Ubuntu does not work.</p>

<p>(c:0j:0)[nowaker@nwkr-tux:~]% cat /etc/default/console-setup | grep XKBOPT<br />
XKBOPTIONS="ctrl:nocaps"</p>

<p>Then reconfigured console-setup and restarted X server. Caps lock still alive.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the solution with xmodmap works perfectly.</p>

<p>I’m quite sure I tested the Debian solution at one point but maybe some other option was in effect. I’ll try testing it further next time I’ll get access to Debian system.</p>

<p>Other ways of modifying Xkb options (xorg.conf or HAL’s policy) should work properly though so you might want to give them a try if you’d prefer them.</p>

<p>As of remiq’s proposal I have thought at one time of an article describing how to turn any key into any other key so maybe in the future.</p>

<p>If you get into more details you can make a single key produce several characters as well — for instance, I have created a <a href="https://pastebin.com/f60a1b70c" rel="nofollow">pl(dvp) keyboard layout</a> (which is <a href="http://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/" rel="nofollow">Porgrammer Dvorak</a> with Polish characters) plus <a href="https://pastebin.com/f2476bc31" rel="nofollow">accompanying ~/.XCompose</a> such that pressing Alt+&lt; produces "&lt;=".</p>

<p>Anyhow, if someone is more interested in creating custom keyboard
layout under X the following link may be
useful: <a href="http://michal.kosmulski.org/computing/articles/custom-keyboard-layouts-xkb.html"

<p>It is very useful for the left pinky. The default position of lctrl key makes the finger overstretch. It’s so apparent. I use with both windows and linux.</p>
