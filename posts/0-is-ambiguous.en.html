<p>It has been a long time since my last entry, so inspired by
<a href=https://blogs.fsfe.org/adridg/?p=1014>Adriaan de Groot’s entry</a>,
I decided to write something about <code>0</code>,
<code>NULL</code> and upcoming <code>nullptr</code>.

<p>I will try to be informative and explain what the whole buzz is about and
then give my opinion about <code>nullptr</code>.  Let us first inspect how
a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_%28computer_programming%29#Null_pointer>null
pointer</a> can be donated in C and C++.

<h2>The confusing <code>0</code></h2>

<p>In C and C++, the literal <code>0</code> has two meanings: it’s either an
octal (yes, octal, here’s a fun fact of the day for you ;) ) literal
representing number zero or a null pointer.  Which meaning is used depends on
context, which compiler can usually figure out.  For instance:

<pre>
<b>void</b> takes_number(<b>int</b>);
<b>void</b> takes_pointer(<b>long</b> *);

<b>int</b> main(<b>void</b>) {
	<b>char</b> ch = 0;	/* number zero */
	<b>char</b> *ptr = 0;	/* null pointer */
	takes_number(0);	/* number zero (argument is an int) */
	takes_pointer(0);	/* null pointer (argument is a pointer) */
	<b>return</b> 0;	/* number zero (main returns int) */
}</pre>

<p>However, if function lacks a prototype or has variable length of arguments,
available information may be insufficient to figure out what programmer meant.
A good example is <code>printf</code> function from standard library:

<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

<b>int</b> main(<b>void</b>) {
	printf("%p\n", 0);
	<b>return</b> 0;
}</pre>

<p>In such situations, the first meaning prevails (i.e. a number), which in turn
makes the above into an undefined behaviour (an <code>int</code> is passed where
a pointer is expected).

<p>Based on that, two things to keep in mind are to <em>always</em> provide
function prototypes and prefer explicit <code>(void *)0</code> to mean a null
pointer when calling variadic functions.

<h2>The confusing <code>NULL</code></h2>

<p>To disambiguate <em>intended</em> context, <code>NULL</code> macro can be
used.  Standard requires that it is defined such that it can be used in pointer
context to mean a null pointer.  In C the macro is often defined as:

<pre>#define NULL ((void *)0)</pre>

<p>This fulfils the aforementioned requirement and in addition guarantees
a warning when it is used as a number, i.e.:

<pre>
$ <i>cat test.c</i>
#include &lt;stddef.h&gt;

<b>int</b> main(<b>void</b>) {
	<b>return</b> NULL;
}
$ <i>gcc -ansi -pedantic test.c</i>
test.c: In function ‘main’:
test.c:4: warning: return makes integer from pointer without a cast
$</pre>

<p>And all was good until C++ came along with its stricter typing rules.  Since
in C++ implicit conversions from <code>void*</code> to other pointer type is
illegal making aforementioned definition invalid:

<pre>
#define OLD_NULL ((<b>void</b> *)0)

<b>int</b> main(<b>void</b>) {
	<b>char</b> *ptr = OLD_NULL;  /* compile time error */
	<b>return</b> 0;
}</pre>

<p>The easiest solution is to define <code>NULL</code> as a plain <code>0</code>
(or <code>0L</code>).  GCC is a bit smarter and uses <code>__null</code>
extension but confusingly even that is treated like <code>0</code> in some
contexts:

<pre>
$ <i>cat test.c</i>
#include &lt;stddef.h&gt;

<b>int</b> main(<b>void</b>) {
	<b>int</b> ret = NULL;	/* no complains */
	ret += <b>__null</b>;
	ret += NULL;
	<b>return</b> ret;
}
$ <i>g++  -ansi -pedantic test.c</i>
test.c: In function ‘int main()’:
test.c:5: warning: NULL used in arithmetic
test.c:6: warning: NULL used in arithmetic
$</pre>

<p>Whenever you use <code>NULL</code>, you have to keep in mind that you never
know what it really is.  This in particular means, that the following code may
or may not be valid:

<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

<b>int</b> main(<b>void</b>) {
	printf("%p\n", NULL);	/* ((void *)0)? 0? 0L? __null? */
	<b>return</b> 0;
}</pre>


<h2>Function overloading</h2>

<p>Fortunately (at least in the context of null pointers), variadic functions
aren’t that common.  Function overloading is what poses more problem since even
with full prototypes, it’s not always possible to determine arguments types
by function name and its arity alone.  For example:

<pre>
<b>void</b> print(<b>int</b> num);
<b>void</b> print(<b>long</b> *ptr);

<b>int</b> main(<b>void</b>) {
	print(0);		/* first function */
	print((long *)0);	/* second function */
	print(NULL);		/* ??? */
	<b>return</b> 0;
}</pre>

<p>The lesson here is that (especially in C++) <code>NULL</code> macro is
ambiguous as well and when dealing with overloaded functions an explicit cast
might be necessary.


<h2>So what about <code>nullptr</code>?</h2>

<p>To help address those issues, C++11 introduced <code>nullptr</code> keyword.
It evaluates to a <code>std::nullptr_t</code> object which can be implicitly
converted to any null pointer (but not to a number).

<p>Unfortunately, one problem remains.  If multiple pointer types are acceptable
in given context, the compiler cannot determine which one to use.  This is most
easy to see with an overloaded function taking different types of pointers as in
the following example:

<pre>
<b>void</b> print(<b>char</b> *);
<b>void</b> print(wchar_t *);

<b>int</b> main(<b>void</b>) {
	print(<b>nullptr</b>);
}</pre>

<p>But at least any ambiguity results in failure to build rather than the
compiler silently choosing one of the options (which may or may not be what we
want).

<p>My other criticism is that <code>NULL</code> was (and still is) a perfectly
fine identifier which served us for years yet the committee decided to throw it
away like yesterday’s jam and instead pollute keyword name-space and people’s
minds with yet another name that means ‘a null pointer’.  The standard could
define <code>_Null</code> keyword and mandate that <code>NULL</code> expands
to <code>_Null</code> which would be much more straightforward.

<p>I used to be a wee bit critical of this new keyword.  I’m still not in love
with it, but I also recognise I’m being in minority (perhaps even minority of
one person).  As such, <code>nullptr</code> is the best we’re gonna get going
forward, though spelling out the pointer type explicitly is also a perfectly
valid solution and don’t let others tell you otherwise. ;)

<h2>Null pointer representation</h2>

<p>The last thing I want to talk about is a null pointer’s representation.
There are two misconceptions that came from the fact that <code>0</code> is used
to mean a null pointer.  The first one is that a null pointer is in fact
represented by a ‘zero value’ (i.e. all bits clear).  The second one is that
when implementation uses a different representation assigning <code>0</code> to
a pointer does not yield a null pointer.

<p>Both of those are incorrect.  In various implementations zero is a perfectly
cromulent address and <a href="http://c-faq.com/null/machexamp.html">other
representations for a null pointer</a> (e.g. all bits set) may make more sense.
Regardless, <code>0</code> always means a null pointer in pointer context and
it’s compiler’s responsibility to translate it into the correct representation.


<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>To sum things up, here are all the tips that you should keep in
mind while programming in C or C++:

<ol>
  <li>Always define function prototypes.
  <li>In C++ use <code>nullptr</code> or <code>(<var>T</var>*)0</code> to mean
    a null pointer.
  <li>In C, if you’re using <code>NULL</code> beware of variadic functions and
  false sense of security the macro might give you.
</ol>

<p>I used to recommend ignoring <code>nullptr</code> keyword but nowadays people
  will look at you funny if you try using <code>NULL</code>.
