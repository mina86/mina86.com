<p>arg max is a set of values from function’s domain at which said function
  reaches its maxima.  That’s certainly <em>an</em> arg max but not the one
  we’re after.  No, this article is regarding the <code>ARG_MAX</code> that
  limits the length of arguments to an executable.  Or in other words, why you
  are getting:

<pre>
bash: <var>command</var>: Argument list too long
</pre>

<p>The <code>ARG_MAX</code> parameter is common among UNIX-like platforms but
  since most such systems have fallen into obscurity, are BSD or are rubbish,
  herein I will focus on a GNU/Linux environment running on a x86_64 platform.
  While this limits the applicability of the information, many concepts will
  apply to other systems and architectures as well.


<h2>Experimentation</h2>

<div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;justify-content:space-between">
  <div style="flex:.8 20rem">
    <p style="margin-top:0">The value of <code>ARG_MAX</code> is no secret and
      can be retrieve with <code>getconf</code> utility.  On x86_64 platform
      it’s 2097152 (or 2 MiB) by default.  To test this limit we can use pretty
      much any command; <code>echo</code> should do.  A simple experiment (as
      shown in the listing on the side) confirms that the tool can be called
      with a one-million-character-long argument.  On the other hand, further
      investigation demonstrates that an argument three times as long works just
      as well which shouldn’t be the case.

    <p style="margin-bottom:0">Turns out that even in minimal shells, such as
      dash and posh, the <code>echo</code> command is a built-in.  Its execution
      is performed entirely within the shell and as such isn’t subject to
      kernel-imposed limitations.  For the <code>ARG_MAX</code> limit to take
      effect the <code>execve</code> system call has to be used.  This can be
      done by executing the <code>/bin/echo</code> binary instead.
  </div>

  <pre style="height:max-content;margin:0 0 0 auto">
$ getconf ARG_MAX
2097152

$ echo '
head -c "${1?}" /dev/zero |tr "\0" A
' >gen-str
$ chmod 755 gen-str
$ s=$(./gen-str 1000000)
$ echo ${#s}
1000000

$ echo "$s" |wc -c
1000001
$ echo "$s$s$s" |wc -c
3000001
$ type echo
echo is a shell builtin

$ /bin/echo "$s"
sh: /bin/echo: Argument list too long
  </pre>
</div>

<p>This time, after redoing the experiment with that executable, the command
  fails even for mere one million characters which should be within
  the <code>ARG_MAX</code> limit.  With some trial and error we can determined
  that the longest argument the kernel will accept is 131072 bytes long
  (including the terminating NUL byte).  However, that’s clearly not the end of
  the story.  It’s easy to see that while <em>a single argument</em> is limited
  to 128 KiB, <em>the whole command line</em> is not.

<pre>
$ /bin/echo "$(./gen-str 131072)"
sh: /bin/echo: Argument list too long
$ s=$(./gen-str 131071)
$ /bin/echo "$s" |wc -c
131072
$ /bin/echo "$s" "$s" "$s" |wc -c
393216

$ /bin/echo "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" \
            "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s"
sh: /bin/echo: Argument list too long
$ t=$(./gen-str $((131071 - 3422)))
$ /bin/echo "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" \
            "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$t" |wc -c
2093730
</pre>

<p>To determine the apparent limit we can try passing more and more arguments
  until we get the ‘Argument list too long’ error.  As we’ll see the value one
  gets is dependent on the environment.  In the shell session shown in listing
  above, I got a limit of 2093730 characters which is only 3422 bytes shy of the
  2 MiB we got as the value <code>ARG_MAX</code>.  What could account for this
  difference?

<p>Since <code>echo</code> prints a white-space character after each argument,
  the number reported by <code>wc -c</code> does effectively count NUL bytes so
  that cannot be where the missing bytes went.  There’s one other aspect of
  command line arguments that has been overlooked so far.  By UNIX convention,
  the first argument of a program is its name.  In the above case
  that’s <code>/bin/echo</code> which accounts for ten characters (again, NUL
  byte is counted).  While it’s something, it still leaves 3412 bytes
  unaccounted for.

<p>The next breakthrough comes once we realise that command line arguments are
  not the only way information is passed to an application.  The other (commonly
  overlooked) method are environment variables such
  as <code>PATH</code>, <code>TERM</code> or <code>USER</code>.  All of them
  contribute to the limit in the same way command line arguments do.  To measure
  how much, we can invoke <code>env |wc</code> which will produce the number as
  well as total length of all the variables.  This isn’t robust against
  variables containing newline characters, but other than that it correctly
  measures used space including NUL bytes terminating each value.

<pre>
$ env |wc
     45      45    2906
</pre>

<p>Environment variables explain further 2906 bytes which gets the discrepancy
  down to 506 bytes.  Close but no cigar just yet.

<p>Third thing to consider is how arguments and environment variables are passed
  to an application.  They end up in <code>argv</code> and <code>environ</code>
  arrays respectively which take up space.  In the example above there are 17
  arguments and 45 environment variables (as seen from the output of <code>env
  |wc</code>) so total of 62 strings.  Each requires an eight-byte pointer in
  corresponding array which in total amounts to 496 bytes.  This <em>still</em>
  leaves 10 bytes.  The <code>argv</code> and <code>environ</code> arrays are
  NULL-terminated but that is <em>not</em> counted against the limit — if we
  were to include those NULL pointers we would overshoot the tally by 6 bytes.
  Something else is afoot.

<p>The final bit of the puzzle is the auxiliary vector.  A Linux-specific
  mechanism which kernel uses to pass additional information to the user space.
  One of the pieces of data this vector includes is the path used to launch the
  executable.  In the example above this path is once
  again <code>/bin/echo</code> and thus perfectly accounts for the remaining ten
  bytes.


<h3>Verification</h3>

<p>To verify all the findings we can try calling different binaries with and
  without environment variables present.  When doing that from a shell it’s
  important to take note of any variables that the shell might automatically
  create when calling programs.  I’ve found that posh is particularly well
  behaved in this regard.  While it makes sure a <code>PATH</code> variable is
  present when it starts, it lets user remove it and later doesn’t try to create
  any more variables when invoking commands.

<pre>
$ env -i posh
$ unset PATH; env
$ s=$(./gen-str 131071)
$ check() {
    "$1" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" \
         "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" \
         "$(./gen-str $2)"
}

<i># 17 arguments, 8 bytes per pointer</i>
<i># 10-byte-long path, once in argv and once in auxv</i>
$ check /bin/echo  $((131071 - 17*8 - 2*10)) |wc -c
2096996
$ check /bin/false $((131071 - 17*8 - 2*10))
posh: /bin/false: Argument list too long
<i># this time 11-byte-long path</i>
$ check /bin/false $((131071 - 17*8 - 2*11)))

$ foo=bar; export foo
$ check /bin/echo  $((131071 - 17*8 - 2*10))
posh: /bin/echo: Argument list too long
<i># Additional 8-byte pointer in environ array plus</i>
<i># ‘foo=bar’ (inc. NUL byte) takes another 8 bytes</i>
$ check /bin/echo  $((131071 - 17*8 - 1*8 - 2*10 - 8)) |wc -c
2096980
</pre>

<p>Calling programs whose paths have different lengths with and without
  environment variables present is in fact consistent with all the rules
  analysed earlier.


<h2>Pushing the limits</h2>

<p>Knowing the limit, the next step is to understand how, if at all, can it be
  changed.  There’s no <code>setconf</code> counterpart to
  the <code>getconf</code> tool which would allow setting the parameter.
  However, there is a way to influence the value on Linux.

<p>To realise how we should consider what do all of the objects counted in the
  limit — command line arguments, environment variables and auxiliary
  vector — have in common.  More specifically, where are they located.  With
  address space randomisation the exact addresses will vary even between runs of
  the same application, but looking at an example addresses proves helpful
  nonetheless:

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr><th>Expression                       <th>Result
    <tbody>
      <tr><td><code>getauxval(AT_EXECFN)</code><td><code>0x7fffac2fcfed</code>
      <tr><td><code>environ[0]</code>          <td><code>0x7fffac2fc473</code>
      <tr><td><code>argv[0]</code>             <td><code>0x7fffac2fc468</code>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td><code>sbrk(0)</code>             <td><code>0x555bd584a000</code>
      <tr><td><code>&amp;global</code>         <td><code>0x555bd4c6a040</code>
  </table>

<p>Yes, that’s it.  All objects of interest are stored on the stack.  It stands
  to reason then that changing the maximum stack size might
  influence <code>ARG_MAX</code> value.  This hypothesis can be tested with the
  help of <code>ulimit</code> built-in which allows reading and modifying
  resource limits such as the maximum stack size.

<pre>
$ ulimit -Ss 1024; getconf ARG_MAX
262144     <i># 256 KiB</i>
$ ulimit -Ss  512; getconf ARG_MAX
131072     <i># 128 KiB</i>
$ ulimit -Ss  256; getconf ARG_MAX
131072     <i># 128 KiB</i>

$ ulimit -Ss $((1024 * 1024)); getconf ARG_MAX
268435456  <i># 256 GiB</i>
</pre>

<p>Correlating maximum stack size with value of the <code>ARG_MAX</code> limit
  we can easily see that the latter is set to one fourth of the former with
  additional restriction that <code>ARG_MAX</code> is no lower than 128 KiB.
  Upper limit on the other hand doesn’t appear to exist.  Or does it?  Let’s try
  a stack size of 42 MiB:

<pre id=bigstack>
$ ulimit -Ss $((42 * 1024))
$ getconf ARG_MAX
11010048
$ s=$(./gen-str 131071)
$ /bin/true "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" \
            "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" \
            "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" \
            "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" \
            "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" \
            "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s" "$s"
sh: /bin/true: Argument list too long
</pre>

<p>Turns out even if the kernel returns a large value of <code>ARG_MAX</code>,
  the limit is always capped at 6 MiB.

<p>On the other end, even if kernel reports <code>ARG_MAX</code> to be 128 KiB,
  that effective limit will never reach more than the maximum stack size.  For
  example:

<pre>$ ulimit -Ss 100
$ exec env -i posh
$ unset PATH
$ getconf ARG_MAX
131072
$ /bin/true "$(../gen-str 102400)"
posh: /bin/true: Argument list too long
</pre>


<h2>The real argument limit</h2>

<p>To quickly recap all the information:
<ul>
  <li id=b1>The maximum length of the arguments to the <code>execve</code>
    syscall is one forth of the maximum stack size but no less than 128 KiB and
    no more than 6 MiB.
  <li>The limit covers: i) all command line arguments, ii) all environment
    variables, iii) pointers to the former two present in <code>argv</code>
    and <code>environ</code> arrays and iv) the path to the executable used to
    run the program.
  <li>In addition, regardless of how high the limit is, a single command line
    argument and environment variable cannot exceed 128 KiB.  Size of
    environment variable is calculated as the size
    of <code><var>name</var>=<var>value</var></code> string.
  <li>String size includes the terminating NUL byte, i.e. it’s the string length
    plus one.
</ul>

<p>And that’s it for now.  In <a href="/2021/the-real-arg-max-part-2/">the next
  part</a> we’re going to look at the kernel code responsible for implementing
  the limit so stay tuned (or should I say smash that <a href="/atom">Atom
  feed</a> button?).

<p id=f1><a href=#b1>1</a> Roughly speaking.  It’s of course impossible to use
  the entire stack for arguments and environment variables since there would be
  no space left for any other information or setting up stack frame.  As such,
  the actual arg limit is capped at less than maximum stack size.

<p style="margin-top: 2em">PS. By the way, despite all the BSD influences in
  XNU, I don’t consider macOS to be a BSD.
