<p>Four years ago I proclaimed that <a href="/2021/regexes-are-broken/">regular
  expressions were broken</a>.  Two years ago I discussed this with BurntSushi
  and even though his expertise in the subject could not be denied, he did not
  manage to change my opinion.  But now, two more years after that, I adjusted
  my stance.

<p>Everything factual I’ve written previously is still accurate, but calling
  regular expressions broken might have been a bit too much of a hyperbole.
  There’s definitely something funky going on with regex engines but I’ve
  realised an analogy which makes it make sense.

<h2>Recap</h2>

<p>In formal language theory, alternation, i.e. the | operator, is commutative.
  For two grammars α and β, α|β and β|α define the same language just like 1 + 2
  and 2 + 1 equal the same number (there are no two different 3s, depending how
  they were constructed).

<p>Nevertheless, most regex engines care about the order of arguments in an
  alternation.  As demonstrated <a href="/2021/regexes-are-broken/#tab"
  class=nl>in my previous post</a>, when matching the string ‘foobar’
  against <code>foo|foobar</code> regular expression, the regex engines will
  match ‘foo’ substring but when matching it against <code>foobar|foo</code>
  they will match the entire ‘foobar’ string.

<p>This is a bit like saying that 5x should give different results depending on
  whether x was constructed as x = 1 + 2 or x = 2 + 1.  Of course software
  engineering and Maths are different disciplines and things don’t directly
  translate between the two.  Nevertheless, I felt justified in calling such
  regex engines broken.

<h2>Prior Art</h2>

<p>Adjustment of my stance on the issue was thanks to other examples where
  programming practice clashes with its theoretical roots.  Below I’ll give
  a handful of examples culminating with one that really changed my position.

<h4>String concatenation</h4>
<p id=b1>Many languages use a plus symbol as a string concatenation operator,
  which isn’t commutative.  Meanwhile in Maths, plus is by convention used for
  commutative operations only.<a href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> Indeed, some
  languages opt for using different concatenation operators:
  D uses <code>~</code>, Haskell uses <code>++</code>, Perl uses <code>.</code>
  (dot), SQL uses <code>||</code> and Visual Basic uses <code>&amp;</code> to
  name a few examples.<a href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a>

<p>However, this is a different situation than the case of alternation in
  regular expressions.  Using plus symbol for concatenation may be considered
  unfortunate, but the operation itself behaves the same way its counterpart in
  Maths does.

<h4>Floating point numbers</h4>
<p id=b3>Another example where Maths disagrees with programming are floating
  point numbers.  They pretend to be real numbers but in reality they aren’t
  even good at being rational numbers.  Most notably for this discussion,
  addition of floating point numbers is not associative and can lead to
  catastrophic cancellation.<a href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> Plus there are NaN
  values which infamously do not equal themselves and can really mess up array
  sorting if not handled properly.

<p>However, this didn’t convince me that regular expression weren’t broken
  either.  After all, I’m perfectly happy to call floating point numbers broken.
  I don’t mean by this that they are unusable or don’t solve real (no pun
  intended) problems.  Rather this is only to emphasise that there are many
  details that engineer needs to be vary of when using them.  This is the same
  sense I used the word in regards to regex engines.

<h4>Logic operations</h4>
<p>In the end what made me more open to the ‘broken’ behaviour of regular
  expressions were logic operators.  In many (most? all?) imperative languages,
  the logic or operator use a short-circuit evaluation.  For example,
  while <code>puts("foo") || puts("bar")</code> and <code>puts("bar") ||
  puts("foo")</code> C expressions evaluate to the same value (one), their
  behaviours differ — the first one outputs ‘foo’ and the second one outputs
  ‘bar’ to standard output.

<p>This is analogous to regular expressions.  When matching
  <code>foo|foobar</code> and <code>foobar|foo</code> regular expressions, the
  result (whether the string matches) is the same, but the side effects of the
  execution may differ.


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>To be clear, I still have doubts whether <code>foo|foobar</code>
  and <code>foobar|foo</code> behaving differently is the right option.
  However, it’s also clear to say that it’s not as broken as I used to think;
  rather, it’s one of the peculiarities of regexes that one needs to be aware
  of.  And specifically, aware of how regex engine they use behave.

<p id=f2><a href=#b1>2</a> Admittedly, at least in some of the cases choice of
  a different operator may have been influenced by factors other than
  ‘mathematical purity’.  Perl has separate set of operators for strings and
  numbers (e.g. <code>$x == $y</code> converts operands to numbers if necessary
  while <code>$x eq $y</code> converts them to strings).  Visual Basic has
  both <code>+</code> and <code>&amp;</code> operators with the latter always
  converting operands to strings first.  In contrast JavaScript is infamous with
  its type coercion and it would likely benefit from having separate
  concatenation operator.
