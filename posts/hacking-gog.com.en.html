<p>If you have a <a href=https://www.gog.com/>GOG</a> account, you might have
  received an email announcing
  a <a href="https://www.gog.com/news/the_harvest_sale_brings_the_juiciest_deals_up_to_91_off">Harvest
  Sale</a>.  While it’s unusual for harvest to last only 48 hours, but apart
  from that naming blunder, the sale is no different than many that came before
  it.  What caught my attention was somewhat creative spot the difference puzzle
  that accompanied it.  Specifically, as pretext to share some image processing
  insights.

<p>Each identified difference presents a discount code for an exciting game.
  Surely, one cannot let it go to waste!  Alas, years of sitting in a cave in
  front of a computer destroyed our eyesight; how could we possibly succeed‽
  Simple!

<!-- EXCERPT -->

<p>Firstly, make a screenshot of the puzzle.  The drawing in the email is rather
  tall so you might need to take a few of them (each capturing portion of the
  picture) or zoom out until the entire illustration fits.  To practice feel
  free to grab the above image of the portion of the puzzle.

<p>With the screenshot ready, open it in an <a href=https://www.gimp.org/>image
  manipulation program</a>.  To make things easier crop it — the default key
  binding for Crop tool is Shift+C — to discard irrelevant parts.  Having done
  that, duplicate the layer.  That can be accomplished through Layer menu or by
  pressing Ctrl+Shift+D.  Now, flip one of the layers.  This operation is
  accessible through the Layer → Transform → Flip Horizontally menu option as
  well as inside of the Layers dialogue.

<div style="float: right; margin: 1em 0 1em 2em">

<p>The Layers dialogue is what we need now as that’s where the magic happen.  if
  you haven’t brought it up yet do it now for example with Ctrl+L shortcut.
  Make sure the top layer is selected and finally choose Difference from the
  Mode drop-down. Et voilà.

<p>Depending on the cropping done at the beginning, the top layer might need to
  be moved a little — key binding for the Move tool is M.  If done correctly,
  the differences should be highlighted with bright colours.
