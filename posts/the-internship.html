<p>Due to my current position, I've been asked 
  about <a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2234155/ rel=nofollow>The Internship</a> several times.  Having very low expectations about that
  title, I'd actually been avoiding it and thus were unable
  to comment.  I have a very special place for
  watching films that I don't expect to be good though—a plane.  So
  here I am, flying to Pittsburgh, and those are some of my thoughts.

<p>Most importantly, apart from being filmed at Google Mountain View
  campus and with some of the Google employees starring in it, the
  film has very little to do with Google.  This should not be
  a surprise though.  In particular, it does not show how Google
  internships work.  I should know, I host an intern.  In no
  particular order:

<ul>
  <li>It's perfectly fine to go for a beer with your boss.  I do it
    all the time.  In fact, a customary way of saying goodbye to an
    intern is going out with the team.
  <li>It's perfectly fine to date a fellow Googler or be married to
    one for that matter.  The usual caveats apply, like you shouldn't
    date your manager or report.  If in doubt, ask HR and they'll
    figure something out.
  <li>Yes, food in cafeterias and µkitchens is free.  Working at Google you may in fact get so used to
    it, that you'll end up taking a ‘free’ fruit in Starbucks.
  <li>You actually can take food home but be reasonable about it.
    Some offices offers plastic containers during dinner so one can
    take a hot meal home.  Moreover, noöne will mind if you take
    a snack every now and then.  Mountain View campus also serves
    lunch on weekends.
  <li>Googlers are not such introverts so as to being unable to talk.
  <li>I may be stating the obvious, but there's no ‘winner team’ and
    each intern is evaluated individually.  It wouldn't make sense any
    other way.  In fact, interns are not teamed up together nor given
    tasks to work on their own (i.e. without Googler's help).
  <li>This again may be obvious, but for the sake of completeness,
    interns never work on such broad variety of subjects.  Writing an
    app, tech support and finding clients?  No one would be able to
    all of do that.  Interns are given a specific task in a scope of
    the team they are in.
  <li>You don't take a full big GBus to take a few people to
    a restaurant.  But yes, something like GBus does exists, and it's
    a shuttle service taking Googlers to and from
    offices in Bay Area.  And they are awesome—convenient and even have
    WiFi.
  <li>Yes, the terms Noogler and Googly, as well as, Noogler's hats
    and TGIFs are all real.  Even though the last one does not take
    place on Fridays in all offices.  There are also other terms.  The
    two I can recall from the top of my head are: Zoogler—Googler
    working at the Zürich office—and Spoogler—spouse of a Googler.
    Their usage varies; some people don’t particularly like them.
</ul>

<p>Other then that, the film wasn't really funny, but the story had
  a few highlights, like that fact that you won't get a job at Google
  if you are a jerk.

<p>The last thing that may be worth mentioning is the fact that
  unfortunately, there aren't so many women working at Google (or at least not in all offices).  This
  is a problem in the whole tech industry.  In my class at high
  school, girls were outnumbered two to one (and that was considered
  a low ratio).  At the university, among almost two hundred students
  in my semester, there were three girls.

<p>So if you are woman interested in science or technology (which is
  probably not my usual reading audience) go for it, and don't get
  morons discourage you.  If you are already studying computer science,
  here are some programs that may help you:

<ul>
  <li>‘<a href="https://www.gnome.org/outreachy/">Outreachy</a>
      helps people from groups underrepresented in free and open
      source software get involved.’ It is hosted on GNOME’s website,
      but is not GNOME-specific.
