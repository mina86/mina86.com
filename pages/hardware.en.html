<p style="display:none" id="elT410"><strong>Lenovo T410</strong>.
Even though it’s my business laptop, I use it all the time for
almost everything.</p>

<p style="display:none" id="elcables"><strong>Electron transmitting
device</strong>.  I have bunch of those under (and above) my desk
tangled together into an untangleable mess.</p>

<p style="display:none" id="elcasio"><strong>Cisco
<i>fx</i>-65</strong>. I have won it in a Math competition while in elementary
school (by getting 2nd place in country or something like that) and I have been
using it ever since, even though nowadays I tend to either use <code>bc</code>
or Emacs’ <code>calc</code>.</p>

<p style="display:none" id="elcharger"><strong>USB charger</strong>.
It’s just a simple electron transmitting device, but also a proof
that paying several hundreds of dollars is worth the money, since
you get to get such useful toys.</p>

<p style="display:none" id="elcomb"><strong>Hair entropy
reducer</strong>.  I don’t even use it that often… I don’t even know
why it’s on my desk…</p>

<p style="display:none" id="eldell"><strong>Dell 2407WFPb</strong>.
My ‘business’ monitor.  Yes, you’ve read it right: Google gave me
a 24″ screen to use at home.  Obviously, I have two more in the
office.</p>

<p style="display:none" id="eldvd"><strong>Death ray</strong>.  This death ray
has limited power output though.  Still, it’s enough to burn plastic.</p>

<p style="display:none" id="elfan"><strong>Arctic Cold Freezer
XTREME</strong> Rev.2.  Despite its name, it’s never arctic cold
though… It’s attached to <strong>AMD Phenom II X3 710</strong>
and <strong>ASRock A785GM-LE/128M</strong>.  The latter is not
really my choice, but my previous motherboard decided to no longer
work, and this one was the only one they had in store that supported
my processor.</p>

<p style="display:none" id="elfiresword"><strong>Firesword</strong>.
Google branded at that.  Best part is that I had to sign a paper
saying I won’t hold Google responsible for damages caused by the use
of it.  Yeah, it produces quite a bit of photons.</p>

<p style="display:none" id="elflashlight"><strong>Electromagnetic
wave generator</strong>.  Useful when I need to dive under my
desk.  Has a chameleon drawn on the cover with mysterious texts
‘Suse’, which is some Maya Linux distribution. But seriously, they
actually are active, and the oldest commercial Linux distribution
still in development.</p>

<p style="display:none" id="elfoot"><strong>Kinesis foot
pedal</strong>.  I don’t use it though.  Wanna buy?</p>

<p style="display:none" id="elgateway"><strong>Gateway
FPD2185W</strong>.  The first screen larger than 20″ I’ve had.
I bought it years ago below the usual price because factory fault it
has.  What fault you ask me? I’ve never noticed any. ;)</p>

<p style="display:none" id="elgfx"><strong>ASUS GTX560</strong>.
Enough to play Zork and Tetris.</p>

<p style="display:none" id="elhdd">2 × <strong>Western Digital
WD2002FAEX</strong>.  Their name indicates that they should be
black, but they aren’t really… More like metallic, like all other
HDDs I’ve seen.  Total capacity of 4 GB, but since they run (mostly)
in RAID-1, its back to 2 GB.</p>

<p style="display:none" id="elheat"><strong>Molecule movement
generator</strong>.  Pretty useful in winter.</p>

<p style="display:none" id="elhp"><strong>HP stress ball</strong>.
I’m not sure when HP switched to producing non-electronic
aaccessories, but there you have it!</p>

<div style="display:none" id="elkinesis">
  <p><strong>Kinesis Advantage
  Pro</strong>. The. Best. Keyboard. Ever.</p>
  <p>In the past, I used to say, that there is no point in buying
  expensive keyboards because the cheapest thing you can get is as
  good as the expensive one. This one proved me wrong.</p>
  <p>Back than, I was using some simple
  Chicony keyboard and frankly, I still think that it was as good as
  many more expensive keyboard, but the so called mechanical
  switches on Kinesis and its unique shape make it the best HID I’ve
  ever used.</p>
  <p>Moltron ergonomic keyboard is actually the only thing I think
  could be considered better, but Kinesiss is slightly cheaper and
  so I’ve decided to get the latter rather than the former.</p>
  <p>In fact, not only one.  I own two of those and have one more at
  work.</p>
</div>

<p style="display:none" id="elkvm"><strong>Belkin Flip DVI-D KVM
switch</strong>.  I don’t really recommend it.  My issue is that
whenever I want to switch between computers, USB keyboard and mouse
are disconnected from one and connected to the other machine.  I’d
much rather the KVM maintained a ‘virtual’ keyboard and mouse so
that both computers would think that something is connected to them
all the time.</p>

<div style="display:none" id="ellogitech">
  <p><strong>Logitech Z-5500</strong>.  I wouldn’t normally buy
  them, but it so happened that a coworker was selling them and
  I managed to get them way under the normal price.  I have two
  problems though:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I don’t know how to use 5.1 under Linux, so I just use them
    in ‘Stereo × 2’ which means rear speakers have the same signal
    as the front ones; and</li>
    <li>on Windows, the centre channel is way too silent in games,
    so I’ve ended up disabling it, reducing the whole system to 4.1
    (still the effect in games is quite nice).</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p style="display:none" id="elmouse"><strong>Logitech
MX518</strong>.  My first ever optical mouse which I enjoy very
much.  It has been with me for a few years and there’s not much
I don’t like about it.  The shape seems almost perfect.  I highly
recommend it (even though now it has been replaced with a G400
model).</p>

<p style="display:none" id="elmug"><strong>Tea storage
device</strong> with a function of oral delivery.  I’ve heard it can
be used with other liquids as well, but I’ve never tried.</p>

<div style="display:none" id="elnexus">
  <p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Nexus</strong>.  You may be mislead by
  the fact that there appears to be nothing in the picture, but
  that’s just an illusion.</p>
  <p>A Christmas gift from Google.  If it weren’t for that company,
  I’d probably never start using mobile phones, but since they gave
  me one and they are paying for my plan, how could I resist?</p>
</div>

<p style="display:none" id="elpaper"><strong>Analogue storage
devices</strong>.  A bunch of those laying around.  Digital is nice,
but analogue has its uses as well.</p>

<p style="display:none" id="elpen"><strong>Kingston DataTraveler
400</strong>.  I don’t even remember since how long I have it.  The
label begins to wear off of it.  Even in the age of ‘da cloud’,
I still find it useful.</p>

<p style="display:none" id="elpipe"><strong>Liquid transfer
device</strong>.  Powers the <strong>molecule movement
generator</strong>.</p>

<p style="display:none" id="elrouter"><strong>Sitecom
router</strong> of some kind.  Got it from my ISP.  Interestingly,
it appears to have a random SSID and WPA2 password.  Still, just to
be sure, I’ve changed them anyway.</p>

<p style="display:none" id="elsamsung"><strong>Samsung
F2380M</strong>.  I’ve actually written about this screen.  No need
to repeat.  Go ahead, look it up on my blog.</p>

<p style="display:none"
   id="elscrewdriver"><strong>Multitool</strong>.  Seriously.  It
has 4 different screwdrivers, a electromagnetic wave generator and
a spirit level.  Maybe not as cool as a <em>sonic</em> screwdriver,
but still nice.</p>

<p style="display:none" id="elsdd">2 × <strong>Intel® SSD, 320
Series, 40 GB</strong>.  Not that big, but that’s because they are
meant to hold just the system and some of my most important data.
They run in a RAID-1 configuration and are Linux-only, not tainted
by other systems.</p>

<p style="display:none" id="elstrip"><strong>High-voltage electron
splitter</strong>.  I’ve actually borrowed it from work, I hope they
don’t mind.</p>

<p style="display:none" id="elubs"><strong>UBS card reader</strong>.
As of time of writing, running out of battery, which means that soon
I’ll end up with no access to my bank account.</p>

<p style="display:none" id="elv"><strong>Electron energy
converters</strong>.  I have a whole bunch of those under my desk.
In fact, my <strong>High-voltage electron splitter</strong> has run
out of sockets, so I had to get two.</p>

<p style="display:none" id="elwallet"><strong>Strellson Money
Storage Device</strong>.  The first, and so far the only, thing I’ve
found use of Miles &amp; more points for.</p>

<div style="display:none" id="elwindows">
  <p><strong>Windows®</strong>.  Yes, I do use them.  Most of the
  time along with <strong>electromagnetic wave
  blockers</strong>.</p>
  <p><small>Windows® is a registered trade mark of Microsoft®
  Corporation.</small></p>
