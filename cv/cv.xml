      <time>June 2021–October 2022</time>
      <head>Senior Software Engineer (NEAR)</head>

      <p>I’ve worked on the stability and performance of the NEAR
      protocol node.  My largest project revolved around archival
      nodes where I’ve managed to reduce storage requirements by over
      50% and further worked on allowing data to be moved from SSDs to
      HDDs.  Since archival nodes keep terabytes of data, those effort
      meant considerable reduction in costs.</p>

      <p>I’ve become perhaps quite <a
      href="https://github.com/near/nearcore/search?q=author%3Amina86&amp;type=commits">prolific
      contributor to the code base</a> and worked on improved external
      interfaces such as monitoring metrics, configuration and JSON
      and Rosetta RPC integration; as well as optimising the code and
      cleaning up technical debt collected through early growth of the
      code.</p>

      <time>March 2019–September 2020</time>
      <head>Core Developer (Hudson River Trading)</head>

      <p>I’ve added low-latency integration to traditional and
      cryptocurrency exchanges.  Those include market data feeds as
      well as order entry interfaces using a mixture of protocols
      (HTTP, FIX, custom binary protocols etc.).</p>

      <p>I’ve worked on improving and optimising HRT’s internal
      libraries.  For example by devising a more robust time-zone API
      (which not only improved performance but also prevented bugs
      during DST switch), pushing more use of new C++ features such as
      string_views (which helped remove memory allocation from hot
      paths) and speeding up some operations through use of SIMD
      instructions.</p>

      <p>I’ve been responsible for ongoing maintenance and live
      troubleshooting during trading hours.  My previous experiences
      have allowed me to promote a better ops practices which have
      improved robustness of HRT’s systems.</p>

      <time>March 2018–January 2019</time>
      <head>Quant Developer, VP (Barclays Capital)</head>

      <p>I’ve worked on models for algorithmic trading of futures and
      currencies.  I’ve developed a framework for automated
      verification of implementation’s behaviour to make sure it does
      not expose the firm to bigger risk than expected and that it
      follows bank’s often strict regulatory and contractual
      obligations.</p>

      <p>As a person fluent in Python and git, I’ve developed several
      utilities integrating with source repository and our development
      workflows.</p>

      <head>Site Reliability Engineer/Software Engineer (Google)</head>

      <p>I’ve worked on myriad of services and projects including:
      ⅰ) a large scale <a href="https://payments.google.com">payments

      transactions made to or by Google, ⅱ) a <a

      headcount, ⅴ) service managing the state of production systems
      and making changes to it and ⅵ) several development and
      productivity applications.</p>

      <p>My roles varied from Site Reliability Engineer (where I was
      responsible for stability and monitoring of services under my
      care), Software Engineer (where I was developing new features)
      and Tech Lead (where I managed a team and directed development
      of a system), often involving a mixture of the three.</p>
